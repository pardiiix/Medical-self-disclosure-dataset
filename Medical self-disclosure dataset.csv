I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.",5,3

"""You have taken the first step and that is asking for help. It can always be worse. It sounds like you are extremely depressed. I too have had problems keeping jobs and friends.. when I got to the point to where I wanted to end my life, I did something that I've always wanted to do. I went skydiving and all my big problems became very small. I think facing death in an indirect way helped turn my life around. Every time I got to the point to where I was depressed I would go skydiving again. About seven years ago I didn't think it to get worse but I got Dystonia torticollis, that's where your muscles start pulling the wrong way. My head lies on my shoulder and I'm in extreme pain all the time. In between being depressed and getting torticollis I actually became successful until I got torticollis. Please try skydiving jumping out of a plane will help. And remember it can always get worse. If you realize how lucky you are and that """"the big problems in life are really not as big as what you think"""" I am now broke and I'm worse off than I've ever been but I feel everyday is a gift.

"""What a fantastic answer, but also a really bad one!! Let me explain...",0,0
​Firstly I'm very pleased to see you are happy and treat every day as a gift. Obviously I'm sorry you have such daily physical problems but I'm sure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. I'm really pleased what you did worked for you and it's encouraging to find a rare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the cost of that has been quite extreme.,0,0
"​But then on the same hand, not recognising how lucky I am isn't the problem, it's knowing that I am and I'm still not feeling good which then further compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know I'm luckier than most, I know things could be worse, I live in an affluent country with water on tap, have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major traumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see I'm selfish, and ungrateful, and petty and all other words - why can't I just be happy?",3.333333333,2
"​I've put my life on the line a few times, both within the safety confines of organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do myself - it doesn't help me. Being near death doesn't impact me positively or negatively - I'm almost apathetic to it.",3,2
"​And this is why your answer is both fantastic and bad! For you, and others it may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only for the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the fact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they also highlight how everyone's issues are unique - and as well intentioned, and even correct, your view that it could be worse it, that can actually make people feel worse.",0,0
"​If we all focused on 'it could be worse' they'd be very few people in this world who could complain, unfortunately it's not that simple. This depression doesn't care that I'm lucky, it just cares that I think badly of myelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak to people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I don't - and that makes it even worse.",4.666666667,3

​I have had a ton of labels I have both researched or been told about that might fit my ways of thinking and acting but the conclusion I reached was that it was all kind of pointless - a label by its very nature is just a broad title to fit many people and when that comes to the brain it's a very pointless exercise. You might be able to group broken limbs in patients but with the head it's nearly impossible - there's too many bits that do or don't apply for every individual. Ultimately a title is only helpful to point you in the right direction to get you personalised help. And it HAS to be personalised.,2,1

And finally I decided I had to talk to someone. I talked to my sister. It was over the course of several talking sessions with her that I learned something: she really, truly cared. I mean--she really, really did. It wasn't that she hugged me and I cried in front of her and it was some disgustingly sweet sh*t, but it was that she listened and when I implied that yeah, lately, I've had suicidal thoughts...",5,3
"Well, she said, """"If you actually, like, took your life, I don't know--I would feel really terrible. Like, I would be really sad. I might commit suicide, too.""""",0,0
"And she is not a suicidal person in any aspect. It just told me that she would be deeply affected by my death and she wanted me around; she thought I was interesting and one of her closest companions and she still does, of course.",0,0
"Hm, I think I'm getting off-topic. You may or may not have someone like that in your life, but you don't know unless you talk to them. Even if you don't, it's out there--you talked to them, and connected with other human beings, and as humans, we crave human contact--even the most reclusive of us. I know I sometimes just need to be alone, but I still need my """"fix"""" of social interaction to feel not-lonely.",1,0
"Now, you mentioned feeling anxious about talking to your doctor about getting more meds. Social anxiety right there. You can search up the definition if you'd like to find several different definitions and examples and stuff that you could relate to and find more information about. However, it's basically that you overanalyze social situations you're in and criticize yourself about your own reactions and actions before, during, and after a certain social interaction, and everything that you did was oh-so-stupid. You're upset about it, of course. You're embarrassed.",0,0
"The thing is, however, is that you're likely not going to see them again. You think it's embarrassing to tell them about your depression, but keep in mind that there's plenty of people like us out there and plenty of people have gone to doctors to get meds for their depression. Your doctor may have seen PLENTY of people who have depression. It's a serious problem that needs treatment--don't imagine that just because it's not a physical illness or injury that it's not as important. It IS important.",5,3
"And if you think you embarrass yourself while visiting the doctor, so what? You talk to them, make a fool out of yourself, but you get your medication. And...you think about it afterwards, and realize, hey, nothing actually happened to you. You're still fine after that one interaction. They're not going to spend all day thinking about you and your apparent making-a-fool-out-of-yourself, so you don't need to either. What could help, I'm not sure, is think about him/her and not yourself. Observe them, and notice any flaws about them, and feel like you're in power of the situation because you're better than them.",0,0

"""I love the way you write! It sounds really verbal! Very nice of you to sign up to reply. How weird is this though; I didn't think I had paranoia but you almost sound like my little sister! I know you're not, but in my head I'm beginning to wonder whether I should write on here!",1.333333333,1
"I probably do have depression, I acknowledge that. I think my personality might not help but I agree, depression is likely. I have social anxiety, I over think far too much, I have mild symptoms of OCD, I have some body issues, I hide my trichotillomania well being male (face) and I'm somewhat of a perfectionist or idealist - if I could have done it better then it was crap.",5,3
"Genetically speaking there doesn't seem to be any history of it in my family. Because of the way my last job blew up, my parents became more aware of the situation. That's not to say they were completely blind to it, but it became more of a discussion. My parents have both had depression due to work but were fine before and after the event that caused it (tribunals etc) but they don't really understand the 'lack of reason' side of it. I shared with them for a while, on both ups and downs, but got the impression it was upsetting them so have largely stopped talking about it. I never mentioned suicide to them. Again, due to the situation my older sister became aware and she too pressed a little but there is a limit you want to talk about things when all it does is upset people and they can't help you anyway. I have not talked about it with other family members. I'm already known as the depressing one, so I try to sound super happy when I'm around family now. I was told that the reason I'm, at least subconciously, left out in family gatherings is because I'm quiet/ serious/ boring (actual terms!). I'm aware they'd care if I wasn't here - most people are genetically programmed to protect their kin, but my absence would make no difference really. I now spend Xmas away from family, I'm fairly sure they're happier for it! I hate being a chore. I love your statement about it being 'disgusting sweet s*t' - that's so very much my style, even in the depths it's very much black humour, sarcasm etc - struggle with sweet stuff!",5,3
"Outside my family there is just my girlfriend. That sounds extreme, but it's really not. I don't have a single other friend, that is equally my fault. But I talk to no one from University days, no ex colleagues etc. I know no-one else. Partially I like it that way, it's easy and I don't feel like a burden, on the other hand I feel like some of them could have fought to 'look after me' - they all gave up very easily. I know that's not fair. You shouldn't test your friends. But on the other hand, if I really cared for someone and knew they were struggling emotionally, I'd put in a little more effort. I wasn't ever mean or snappy with them, I just kind of disappeared. But it's not their job to understand mental issues, they have their own busy lives with their own problems.",5,3
"So I sometimes speak to my girlfriend, less so these days though. When it all hit the fan I had no choice but to share everything with her, not that it was brand new information of anything - I've been with her for a long time. But maybe the intensity of the feelings was new, of the fact they were always there. But again, there's very little she can do so why depress her. I don't want to see her cry because of me. So I've largely stopped talking about things, in a way that might give her the impression I'm improving. Occasionally stuff slips out, or I sarcastically mention 'leaving' but I cover it well now. I still tell her to find someone else, I cover it in a light/jokey way but, although I'm not stupid and I know she sees though it, it is kind of an acceptable level of sharing.",4,3
"You're right about social anxiety too. That I fully recognise. I care way more than I should, or want to, about others thoughts. Doesn't stop it though. I do analyse everything I've said and done before and after events but I can't forget it - really stupid example; I still remember saying something that was taken the mick out of at school, probably really mildly, and that was about twenty five years ago! How the hell can I get over this when I still stew over stuff I said when I was 9?!",3,2
"Despite seeing every flaw in myself I don't take criticism well, not in a grumpy way but in a defeatest way. If I'm told a million things are good but 'this' needs improving then it was an awful experience. I know that is both ridiculous and common but want it stop effecting me so much. In complete contrast I am very patient and forgiving of others, I'll always see the other side of the argument and I'll happily give people as much time as they need. I'm the epitomy of 'do as I say, not as I do!'. I know where I'm going wrong, I know my thought processes are messed up, but I just don't know how to fix them. I can't think of many situations where I've felt 'better' than anyone else - the closest I get it wondering why horrible people in this world are more likely to succeed; stupidity is rewarded (TOWIE type), rudeness is applauded (Cowell), stabbing people in the back is relabled 'ambition', and generous people get walked on and criminals win the lottery!",2.333333333,1
"I'm really happy you've started to figure your life out. You sound very intelligent and in control. You also mentioned being in school so I suspect you are quite young; for you to have such a good grip on your feelings and recognise triggers and mental health issues is quite impressive. Is it an avenue you have interest in? I'm genuinely happy you have got such a grip on it early, understanding it early may help you in the long run - I don't know, but I suspect the longer this is left the harder it is to undo the 'learning to hate yourself' that is embedded in to you. Much like whe I used to teach, the longer you left a mistake/misconception with a child the harder it was to 'unteach' it - so I just have 34 years to unteach myself!",1.333333333,1

"""Thank you So much for the reply rsjg. Here it goes.. My problem is something too irrigative even myself. I am unmarried and i am 26 years old. I was in relationship with a guy more than 5 years.. We broke up many times and compromised too many times. It’s all just bcz I have bad habit of not hurting anyone. Whatever he does I used to excuse him. However he was kinda guy with negative/inferiority complex. He always used to think that I ll cheat him even though I did lot many sacrifices for him and waited for 5 years. He always used to imagine that I have other affairs even if I say 100 times dont think negative. His words tortured me like hell. I Started to doubt myself by listening same kinda blamings from him every time. Finally decided to come out from that relationship. I said OK to my parents for their process of searching guys for me. But my mind set is not allowing me to say OK to any of the guys they show. I get too many questions and I find too many faults in everyone. Even sometimes I feel like why do I get marry and spoil that guy's life? Sometimes I feel I dont want marriage and run away from all. Whole village started to talk wrong about me. I do even started to doubt myself. Am I mental?",3,2

Both of these show some strength but, again, being single is not a bad thing. Be single for as long as you want or until you find the right person.",0,0
"I keep coming back to the feeling there is a cultural reason for you wanting to be married/ with someone? That is very difficult for me to advise.

I know we all like to think of life as being poilte but some people simply can not accept others ways of thinking so it is sometimes better to just move to where you are accepted for who you are, whether that be single, old, young, gay or 'weird'!

"As for your relationships with guys then, again, it's hard to put a finger on the 'issue'. In fact a lot of issues are not gender specific - you can't help who you find attractive.

If you are very attractive then you should only take it as a compliment. You will never stop people finding you attractive or not, it's uncontrollable.

"I have experienced loss. But I know that time fixes everything, life moves on whether you want it to or not. It's a poor example but it's most accurate I can give you that is based on real, not academic, events.

Even now, if you think of absolute necessities, it's quite easy to achieve that - take away TV, phone, entertainment, snacks etc and absolute bare essentials (all people had hundreds of years ago) are very easy to achieve. The problem arises, we agree, when your wishes/knowledge grows. We should be happy to just want food and shelter but we are conditioned to want more, no one would be happy in this day and age without their luxuries. It's an extension on Maslow's needs - where true happiness comes from is really where your knowledge sits comfortably with your reality and your needs. So hundreds of years ago people hoped for house and food and were happy if that was largely comfortable, whereas now the 'basic' need is often a job, or a TV etc.",0,0
I slight caveat to that argument though is the situation I find myself in where my basic needs are more than met but I feel lost in an emotional sense - like a disconnect from society and expectations. If you feel depressed because of material concerns then I imagine that could be channeled into an ambitious career path. But I'm just guessing and could not possibly pretend to know even a single answer.,3,2

"""Hi, I'm feeling much the same at the moment - which is why I'm back on a depression forum...",5,3
"HOWEVER. To give you some hope, I'm going to list some of the things that helped for me. I had depression for around 15 years, probably longer and kept plugging away, fighting it in every way I knew how. I had multiple courses of therapy and counselling, different anti-depressants, I even self-diagnosed with various illnesses because I was so sure that there was a biochemical reason for the depresssion, and wanted to fight the cause, not take anti-depressants for the effects. Long story short I have discovered a few things that help:",5,3
"1. Therapy. Please don't give up with this, I had loads of useless therapy (eg. rubbish therapist/ wrongly targeted - I could tell you some stories!) but then had a course of psychodynamic therapy which was great. It didn't feel as though it was working at the time, but afterwards, I was in one of the situations which would normally upset me, and a switch went in my brain, and so much fell into place. AFter that I had 10 years of feeling pretty good. TEN YEARS. That's something to fight for, right? Just recently I'm starting to crumble again, but I've had those ten years, and I have hope I can get more with help.",5,3
"2. Medication. I was tried on SSRIs, and to start with they worked ok-ish, but then I developed an intolerance to them even in tiny amounts, so my doctor tried me on an SNRI. It took me 6 months to settle into it, and for the panic attacks to subside, but it changed physical things I didn't know I was missing, for example, seeing colours properly. After 20 yrs of muted washed out colour (I didnt' even know what I was missing, thought it was normal) I still get joy out of looking at something as simple as a piece of vivid blue plastic.",5,3
"3. On my endless quests for self-diagnosis for the CAUSE of the depression, I have discovered that Vitamin D3 really helps. I was prescribed around 3000iu a day. I now only take 2000 when I remember. This is not sounds science, just observation. Please do your own research. Oh, and I think you're supposed to take magnesium because vit D can deplete it.",5,3
"4. I was recently diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME). The treatment in the UK is CBT and excercise. However, being stubborn, once again I refuse to just chat about how tired I am so I did my own research on the internet. I found a site which connects CFS with disturbances in gut flora (friendly bacteria) and the more I researched, the more I found that this is a very new area of study which is being properly investigated by actual scientists. The theory is that we all need a VARIETY of friendly bacteria and if you just keep topping up with yoghurt, you only get one kind. So I found a supplement on the internet with around 30 different kinds, and the good news is that it has not only given me more energy but improved my mood. Again, this is just my own observation, not double blind trials or anything, but to my mind, it's worth sticking with as it can't do any harm.",5,3

I've had some dreadful doctors and a few awful therapists too (quick examples of bad therapy:,5,3

"2) the psychologist who was obsessed with me saying that I sometimes had a glass of wine (literally one) in the evening after a stressful day to calm down, and made it his mission to get me to admit that I had an alcohol problem, to the extent of ignoring anything else I wanted to talk about. He didn't see the irony in himself not being able to function in the morning without coffee.",5,3
3) the psychologist who was unable to rephrase anything from her CAT printouts and shouted at me if I didn't understand them. This one actually did a lot of harm and should be struck off).,5,3

"""After reading through this thread, I feel like I need to reply. The biggest pop-up here for me was when you described yourself as 'boring'. Thing is, reading through this thread made I felt very drawn to you. I've never been drawn to a single 'boring' person, so I felt this had to be said. I don't want to go overboard as you clearly deal with compliments the same way I do. But simply because you don't drink, smoke or do wild things does not make you boring. You're clearly a very intelligent, insightful person. Your sense of humour also shines through on many posts. I would love to read a book, article or anything at all you wrote. I reckon there are some people who'd call being smart a boring thing, but they're just stupid, eh?",0,0
"I recognize a lot of issues and ways of dealing with them. I've dealt with things much in the same way. I've lived in cycles aswell. Though mine focused more on periods where I could pretend I was fine and periods where I couldn't. I'm also very familiar with feeling boring, caring about people too much and just feeling like a burden in general. You're a lot healthier in that sense, I've managed to push absolutely everyone away from me for that. I feel our situations are fairly similar. I talk to my mother maybe once a month, sister even less. I suppose my 'gf' is my son, as I'm also 100% sure he'd be better off without me. He lives with his dad, who wants nothing to do with me. Besides them, I have no-one.",4,3
"Honestly reading through this thread is quite bizarre, as a lot of the parts sound like they were written by me but altered by someone more intelligent. There's so much I can relate to. I used to feel like I had no reason for being depressed either, but some psychologists I've seen have made me realize there's actually quite many things. Have you ever considered the fact you might have something in your youth that triggered your depression? There's so many different, even insignifcant seeming things that can affect our psyche. Allthough personally I'm against the whole idea that all our problems stem from our childhood, I have to admit there is some truth to it. Some of the issues don't start popping up untill the later years. To me it seems like your caring side might be a part of the cause, it not the biggest, for your depression. But even if there's no ''real'' reason for the cause of your depression like you say, doesn't mean you shouldn't be. Even the smallest thing can start the downwards spiral, and leaving it unattended only makes you fall faster. Like me, I completely burned myself out in my youth, trying to help a person that didn't deserve my help to begin with. The burnout slowly turned into depression, which went on unattended and left me pretending I'm fine. Now it's in a point where I can't even pretend anymore. So I basically started depression from nothing like you say. Sure, during the time other stuff happened, before that and later on aswell. I can now say I have a very good reasons to be depressed, but the start? That was mostly due to my own stupidy and stubborness. I should have left the person I tried to help. If I had, my tale now, 10 years later might be very different.",5,3
"I guess what I want to say is, you're too similar to me to be boring. *grin* And that there's no good or bad reasons to be depressed. Even if someone else suffered 'more', only the person in question can decide how much damage it did. Sometimes, it may seem as if someone deserves to suffer more because of their circumstances, but that doesn't mean you're not entitled to it. Pain is pain and it's all bad.",1,0

I think a lot of people use humour to cover their insecurities or lack of self-esteem and that's why I'd say a majority of people with depression aren't easily identifiable - we're not crying in the corner but being light and 'quippy' in public before getting home and lying on the bed so shattered from the public persona we try to portray.

I can get by etc but I know a million people who are way more intelligent that me, I'm very average... maybe just a little lazy too! I have never studied/ revised for anything but seem to manage but I'm certainly not a top of the class, super intelligent type! Me and a former colleague (teaching) used to comment 'who are the stupid ones?' the undereducated teen parents who are given all they need on benefits whilst seeing their friends and taking all kinds of illegal substances or us, working hard for no reason, little gratitude and a public perception that we're lazy?!

I went along the 'successful' route but ended up in the struggling financially destination. I did all the 'right' things but got nothing out of it. I ended up in the same place as they ones who did the 'wrong' things but without the fun, the family, the large social circles that come with those decisions! You're right about me caring too much - I recognise this and not in a martyr kind of way, but in a 'why do I care what a random stranger thinks of me but I really really do, kind of way. But that's also tied to self worth to some degree, someone else always deserves it more than me so I'll give anyone anything as I don't deserve it. I can work for hours on someone else's CV or train them to get a job they're probably not qualified for because they're nice people but I'll pay only lip service to anything that may benefit me.

You also recognise that you are worth more than some people demand. It is not wrong to make mistakes, it's wrong to not recognise them as mistakes (even if you make them a million times again!!). I'm no expert at all, but at the 'start' maybe you didn't give yourself enough leeway/slack and that's what kicked off the rest of the stuff - you probabaly were depressed at the start but just didn't think it was important enough to get depressed over!",3.666666667,2
"I recognise that everyone is different and a minor set back for one can be a significant mountain for another. I agree completely with you, pain is pain and circumstance and history do not dictate what should hurt and what shouldn't.

You don't need to be happy now, you just need to plan a route to where you might be happy in the future. We'll stumble and fall along the way but I believe that if you can plan that route to where you want to be then there is always enough hope to carry on and be happy it small successes even if you never get exactly to where you want to be.

Even the best mums in the world COULD do more, so if you're going to sacrifice everything for him then you can do that positively. in a ridiculous scenario you could devote your whole life to him, every penny you have goes to him, every minute he's available you're there for him. If you want to give up your life, then just give it to him instead! On a more serious note though, if you take this line of thinking on board, you may find there are secondary benefits - say you can pick him up from school x number of days a week, you get to know a few other mums who are standing by themselves waiting for their kid (ignore the bitchy gaggle of parents that are present in every class group!!) and that begins to widen your social group. Take him to a club once a week (football, athletics, cinema - whatever you have around you) and again you may find a few like minded souls. You may find instead of feeling like a burden to him you feel like you are enriching his life even a little.

In the same way if someone is bad at their job and gets sacked - it doesn't make them a bad person it just means they weren't made for that job. Failure doesn't equal bad.

It can be particularly bad if things strike a chord with you. As for crying at everything, I completely understand.... In fact that's all I'll say. The key thing to focus on is you have a handful of friends to help you when you feel low, try to value and maintain that.

Robin Williams death greatly effected me despite me not being a world famous comedian with millions in the bank or being a performer and life of the party.

Furthermore, maybe fear keeps them away - very few people really understand mental health issues, even if you do try to explain it to them. Hard when you can't explain it to yourself! Actually I never really told my friends I had issues, I just pushed them away and they didn't really fight. The one who knew more than others I simply think didn't understand or value the issues. I think ultimately people just gave up! I'm stubborn. Maybe I tested them to some degree too which wasn't fair, when they didn't repsond in the way I hope - everyone lost.

I have moved a fair bit, I have lost old friends and replaced them with new friends who I have now lost again. I have changed jobs to escape bad things and ended up being in exactly the same situation again in each one. I have left lovers because I feared they would be better off without me. I always change, but other than being proven right about my issues that doesn't always help!

I actually can't think of anything that I want to stay alive for, eventually you're going to miss something even if you live to 100! Nothing greatly inspires me, the few things that might (like travel) are too expensive and make me realise how much of a drain on my partner I am. In fact every dream I had is now a nightmare as the reality is they are impossible and even the most positive of person admits that with me. I am plagued by logic and unfortunately, it's rarely disputable. Doesn't matter how much you dream it or want it, you're not going to be the first 75 year old footballer!

Haha at least you find a lover, you must have a fairly decent level of attraction, I haven’t been in a proper relationship… the closest one was when they cheated on their partner with me, and that sort of scenario has happened with me quite a few times.

When you talk about the logic – is it the age thing? So you can’t do something because you’re too old? I’m obviously not gonna say something stupid like “you shouldn’t give up”, somethings you just can’t do.

You say that it has taken a worrying and unexpected twist - I think you need to look at it differently. I believe the worst part of most things is not knowing, good or bad. For example when waiting for a job offer you might be a bag of nerves but once the call comes, positive or otherwise, there is the release of tension. Obviously all those emotions are heightened when it is a relationship but you have to try and look at this weeks possible conclusion as closure - either it'll work out perfectly or it's finished forever.",0,0
"​So plan for the worst. What's the absolute worst thing that could happen? The person doesn't respond in the appropriate way, shuns you. There are ripple effects that mean others shun you (I'm doing proper doomsday response here - I don;t know how inappropriate your feelings are). Is that really going to make you feel worse than you do this very minute? You already believe it anyway. So knowing you were right, knowing it was a disaster, what do you do? What can you do? You have to move on, as hard as it'll be. But surely that's a billion times better that this state of depression limbo where you hate day to day but keep going because of the whole 'what if'. It's like waiting to be sacked or something - you're fairly sure it's coming, you don't want it to but the pressure of it daily means then when it finally does come there is an element of relief.",0,0

The worst case scenario is they 'die' to you -but that doesn't mean you have to - even widows move on, life moves on, painful as it may be for long periods of time.

"""I've never replied to any of these but when I read yours I felt like I was reading exactly what I would have written. Even your replies were identical - right down to researching HFAS - just out of interest. I'm sorry if I step on toes; I'm actually just blurbing my thoughts after reading your post as a way of processing my own thoughts really. I'm always open to learning new things but I always end up at the same pointless reasoning you speak about. I have tried talking to people and therapists and whenever I get to the topic of the point of life no one seems to prove to me otherwise that life is inevitably pointless. I would love to just slink into the background and disappear, preferably in a way that doesn't hurt my bf, family or friends. I have also felt like a type of burden on them. I also have the exact same cycle with jobs, friends etc. I tried medication with the exact same result. I took myself off them after awhile. And I'm in this state for absolute no reason at all; well no conventional reason any way.",5,3
"The thing that caught my attention though about your post was your people-pleasing habit. I feel like the """"reason"""" may actually lie in that habit. I have the exact same thing; the easy-going casual confidence. I actually let myself go for so long at one point that I got chronic fatigue and ended up in a nursing home for 3 months because i was physcially so tired. After i recovered I thought it was caused by my lack of personal boundaries and inability to say no to people always needing me (which is a people-pleasing trait) but years later i realise that its deeper than that. People pleasing is the cause for all this depression and pointlessness (however, not the root cause)",5,3
"Think about it, I know you will because, like me, we over-think everything. It's why we are so good at people pleasing. When you think so much, you're fully aware of other people's needs at all times so you get good at knowing what the """"right thing"""" is to say or portray and everybody loves the 'cool, calm and collected folk'. This all gets very tiring for people like us though because essentially that is not who you are in essence. (I'm actually quite socially anxious, I get panicky over small things etc) Everytime you do that you're pushing yourself down to please others. (I do seem to find happiness in pleasing others but this is temporary and tiring and feeding a habit). Finding out the real reason for why you do that is key to possibly lessening the depression. I think the reasons differ for each individual. Whether it be self-worth issues, lack of confidence, learnt behaviour from parents/society, habitual/addictive behaviour. (those are the root-causes) Why do you like to people-please? What is the real reason. I think we know all these answers when we're honest deep-down but if not, the answers uncover themselves when we ask ourselves these questions repeatedly.",4,3
"Life is pointless when you're not living it the way you want to be or living it the way that feeds you and stimulates you appropriately. Living life for everyone else is incredibly tiring leaving you with no energy to be bothered to live life for you. You're literally not fulfilling yourself..leaving yourself empty, without purpose...aka: pointless.",1,0
"Knowing the root causes for why you people-please might give you an indication of what behaviours you need to change to ease the depression/negative thinking. Now, the problem I have with this is: """"ok that's the reason/diagnosis/definition etc etc but what if this habit of people-pleasing and way of thinking is so ingrained that this pointless perspective I have is just who I really am?"""" Then what? This kinda thinking is actually just rooted in the fact that I just over-think too much and it is in this instance that it is not serving me, it's not fulfilling me and if i want to get better then I have to stop that kind of thinking. If a habit is not serving you, stop and do the opposite. Obviously that's said easier than actually being done. I am a thinker and with that I can reason anything to make logical sense and I am in need of being constantly stimulated. (It sounds like you have the same ability which can also be our own 'disability'?) I can rationalise anything and anything results in pointlessness. And if that type of thinking is who I am then I need to accept it but not let it limit me.",3,2
"But at the end of the day..these are all layers that need to be realised and then peeled back over time. For me, the severe lack of confidence, comparing myself to others with a perfectionist/idealist view and lacking pupose is what drives me to people-please and also makes me feel like a burden on others and ultimately feel like there is no point to life.",4,3
"I think there are a few small-impact but effective steps to take that will slowly adjust your thinking that you're being a burden to others, depression & physical/mental tiredness. Eat well, sleep well and excercise. take natural seratonin. This is not the solution but it helps in the background while you're sorting out the more important issues. It's impossible to feel the way you do without reason. There has to be a reason. Yours is not the conventional reason of PTS, loss, finance, family disruption etc. Your reason will be something else that you have to ask yourself honestly and start fixing and building or healing that part of you.",0,0
"Then to help the mental stimulation; do something that makes you and only you feel good on the inside. Keep yourself positively stimulated, do things that you'll be good at. It builds confidence and purpose over time. Usually helping others does the trick. or researching the things that genuinly interest you. Find activities that direct your over-thinking to something that's more productive for you. Surround yourself with people who think/talk like you that support you and build you back up. In this process you'll find who you are again, find that person that has been supressed in the process of people-pleasing. Surround yourself only with people who know that you lack self-confidence so they can build you up. Life is about relationships after all. (showing my bf how anxious i really was as a person was such a relief because he responded with """"i already know that's who you are, tell me how I can help you"""" So instead of people-pleasing and connecting with everyone else on their level rather do things that re-connect yourself to you. You're tired because you've depleted yourself, put yourself down by saying you are a burden to others, said yes to others and no to yourself...that is tiring and so you need help to re-build youself up. live a fulfilling life like how you want it.",4,3
"I hope that helps in someway. Your post has helped me realise a few things and reminded me that I'm doing the right thing for me at this point in my life..and I mean this in the most unselfish way but more of a survival and self-sustaining kinda way. Don't let yourself get so physically tired like i did, Chronic fatigue took 2 years of my life to recover. Re-energise slowly by making a few minor adjustments to thought processes and self-fulfillment.",5,3

p.s. From personal experience only: admitting you are depressed for no apparent reason helps and start the journey of finding the reason that has caused it. One is depressed because they have suppressed oneself and not fulfilled one's true self-expression. I don't think this requires meds but just incorportaing more self-expression rather than self-depression. Find ways to build up that confidence,5,3

I think religion plays a major role in mental health i tried to work out from the very beginning why this is affecting me tracing it all back and realised that i was brainwashed. I sometimes would rather not have known or rather not been told about God and whilst i believe there must be i'd have rather worked this out myself if i was ever going to. I have honestly thought about suing over this but i'd have more chance of winning the lottery. I asked my mother why i was put in a catholic school she replied because i was and whilst this made me angry because it was the exact answer i was dreading but expecting i don't blame her as i don't think a lot of people understand how it can negatively affect someones mental health.,4.666666667,3

I am not suppose to read it with the hope of changing others. I can share what helps me but ultimately their life is their choice.

I came across something called Childhood Emotional Neglect on the internet a couple of years ago and it immediately clicked for me. It is something which until now has been virtually ignored by mental health experts but is gathering pace now. It's to do with never learning to experience and deal with our emotions through a healthy and nurturing environment. Because of this we dampen down our emotions in order to survive then either have great problems learning to reconnect with them or are unable to completely.,4,3
According to CEN emotions are what connect us to ourselves and lead us to have a rich and fulfilling emotional life. The good news is you can to some extent teach yourself how to reconnect and I am doing this right now. Have a look at this and see if it can help you. I hope so.,1,0

"Thanks hypercat. Really useful link. I think I experienced one or more of those things from my parents. They were both single children born in the Thirties from very traditional backgrounds and would have no access to the information we have today. I cannot blame them but have never had a close relationship with them. Interestingly my sister rebelled and was a bit wild and I sort of crumpled and shut down. She has a much wider life than me now with children and a partner, whereas I keep myself to myself more but we both have suffered with a depressive outlook and suicidal thoughts. Dunno about her as we aren't close (surprise) but mine continue. Just started really addressing things now, so thanks again for your help.",5,3
You are very welcome Chris. It always puzzled me why I had depression from childhood and have problems in relationships. I wasn't beaten or abused etc so I couldn't fathom it.

If we do all that and keep it real we will be in a good place. Life is a journey, there is only one destination. So we have to enjoy the journey or change our mode of transport. I have tried a lot of fairly objective self analysis in a 12 step recovery programme (the addiction was not the problem, it was me) and I understand a lot of my problems and character flaws.

Our words have substance nutriance and life. They are not spoken from putty or a know it all point of view. our words are of the same dish of pain and suffering. I once heard if we are unable to love a person that has pastaway our sorrow is not of the loss but rather that we are unable to give the love we want to give that causes us sorrow.

"I have been experiencing this for the last few months, I have been searching the web looking for answers.  I am a 45 year old female, in good health, I take no medications, thin, active, I eat healthy, so I am at a loss. I have this feeling like there is something under my right rib cage as if something is stuck underneath or enlarged. At first I thought I had strained a muscle b/c I had been working out in the yard the day before it started. It doesn't hurt, it just feels like there is something there that shouldn't be but when I touch the area there is no swelling or bulge. After about 3-4 weeks when it wasn't going away I went to see my doctor. They did blood work, urine labs and sent me for an ultrasound of gallbladder, all came back normal. I have no other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, etc. just this feeling like something is there. It seemed to go away on it's own and then came back and has come and gone since sometimes lasting a few days, sometimes a few weeks. When it is back wearing a bra is uncomfortable. Sometimes there is a warmth or burning sensation in the area. The only other symptoms I have had that I think are related are these: A few months before this started I experienced a fluttering sensation, almost like when I was pregnant and the baby moved, in the same location, a couple of times. Since this has started, on 3 or 4 different occasions, I have experienced a charlie horse like spasm in the same area, below the right rib, when bending over from a sitting position. Does anyone have any answers as to what this might be?  Does it sound like IBS? Peptic Ulcer?",5,3
"Sounds like a Hiatus Hernia to me - I have one plus lots of other problems too. I too find wearing a bra very uncomfortable most of the time. Do you suffer from Gastric Reflux? Raising the head end of your bed by about 4 ins helps, as it stops the acid coming back in the night. Certain foods aggravate it, ie Acid foods, fatty foods, alcohol.Having an endoscopy will verify this, but need to see an upper GI specialist first. Good luck",5,3
I am having huge problems I have been ultra sound and blood test done to the max I have a hyena hernia and 3 gallstones had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy I have no relieve and wearing a bra has dug into muscle under breasts from swelling og upper stomache...running out of oprions tried everything stress doesn't help either,5,3
I have same and had the same tests if you find anything out please let me know it's driving me mad!,1.333333333,1
"Hi there! I think this thread is old but I just saw you posted a couple months back. I've been having the symptoms for several months (feels like something is stuck under my right rib, not much else) Lab work came back fine. Gallbladder checked out perfectly clear, but it turns out I have a lesion on my liver. Getting an MRI next week. I had sudden chest pain in the middle of the night a few days ago but not again since. Have you had anyone look at your liver?",5,3
"I had a couple lesions on my liver when I went in for an ultra sound and CT scan.....but they said a lot of people do...not to be concerned 🤔, I'm going in for an MRI and a thyroid ultrasound on Friday to find out why I have this bubble feeling under my right rib and now an irratated raspy throat at times....I also have bloating at times....having troubles with constipation.....they said I had a hiatal hernia when they did my colonoscopy and endoscopy, As well as acid reflux but I never had any heartburn until after my tests were done. The Dr put me on Zantac and then Prilosec then I started getting heartburn... So I got off of them and now I get heartburn quite often and it's the type of heartburn that starts in the morning and doesn't go away until I go to bed😣 so I will let you know what the doctors fine on my MRI .....this is very frustrating it's been going on since January😥",5,3
Good luck! Let me know how that MRI goes. I'm hoping mine will also happen this week. The great thing about an abdominal MRI is they should be able to see pretty much everything so I hope both of us get some sort of diagnosis. I'll report back with what I find!,4.666666667,3
"Everything looked normal but they weren't able to diagnose the liver lesion. I am having another MRI in November to see if it changes. They believe the liver lesion is an incidental finding and they do not believe the liver is causing my discomfort. I am seeing a GI doc today and having a pelvic ultrasound tomorrow. They want to rule out things like ovarian cancer, cysts, and endometriosis. I will keep you posted! What did you find out?",5,3
"Hello , I had this problem too. I have a hiatus hernia , could not endure it a second time so I have been taken off the lust for an MRI on my liver . When I had an ultra sound my gall bladder was ok but it revealed a light patch on my liver , hence the MRI referral . I was on Lansoprazole for gastric reflux but haven’t taken it for a week as I hate taking tablets permanently. The reflux hasn’t reoccurred as yet but the under the rib discomfort has! Don’t know what to do now?!",5,3
"Was all alright? They saw 2.5 Cm lesion on my liver too- when checking me after a hernia repair as i have abdominal pains after surgery- but after MRI though they said all ok -nothing dangerous.

"Hola Kit, I have a ton of severe stomach issues. I am not a doctor but, I do know that the stomach es actually in the upper left section of the abdomen and the gall bladder es in the upper right section. Although a CT scan has been done and the results came back ""ok"", it does NOT necessarily mean that everything es perfectly fine with the gall bladder... Not folks that review CT Scans, MRI ' S etc. are skilled... Some doctors may determine that you have ""sludge or small gall stones"" and not consider it a big deal because medicine claims that the ""MAJORITY"" of patients have no pain at all... YOU could be in that rare category of folks that have pain. I am no a doctor but, if it does not feel the way that it normally should, there es something going on. Sounds like something in that area may be swelling for whatever reason at times. ...but, the gall bladder can certainly cause those periodic sharp pains... I would definitely obtain a second and possibly a third opinion if necessary. Could be scar tissue... Regardless, do no take it lightly. IFAlso, blood work can be misinterpreted and labs can make mistakes. I certainly will keep you in prayer my friend. 😊",5,3

"I've had several different feelings under the right rib area. I've had gallbladder removed years ago, full hysterectomy. For several years, I feel random light pinch like pains under right rib in the abdomen area, comes and goes, lasts seconds . Other times, it feels like the ribcage itself that's sore, just on the edge, that pain was also intermittent. I thought maybe poor posture? But now not so sure it's posture related. I've also had awful charlie horse/cramps, muscle spasm in right rib cage. But last 2 weeks, I've had both pains and although they come and go, it's lasting. I have diahrea and some mushy stools but doctor say it's likely IBS and because I don't have a gallbladder anymore. I've had bad reflux last year as well.

Ask for a HYDASCAN. I went through several months with a pain under my ribs on my right side. Had all the tests mentioned in the string and one I didn't see. There is a test called a hydascan. With this test they found my gallbladder actually had essentially almost stopped working. A week later it was taken out and I was better. So ask for a hydascan if they haven't found anything with the normal tests. Sister and a friend had the same and both only had to suffer for under a month as I recommended the test and they also had theirs removed as they had similar results.,5,3
Hi I too have a hiatal hernia & have all the same symptoms. Apple Cider Vinegar has definitely helped . I was given Lansoprazole for Reflux but stopped taking it in August .

"I have the same issue, pain under the right upper rib cage so severe I feel like I'm going to pass out! Went to see GP he said gallbladder most likely had an ultrasound & blood test everything is normal. Later that night I was rushed to the ER for the pain, had CT scan and again normal. Went back to my GP the next day & he admitted me to the hospital, they did a HIDA scan my GB was functioning at 10% so they took it out. The surgeon told my family that the gallbladder looked great once they had it out & he doubts that was the problem. 3 weeks post op & I'm still in the same pain feels like when your pregnant & the babies foot gets stuck in your ribs. I'm so frustrated because now I have more issues nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and not eating. I just had a CT scan with contrast and that came back normal too, I have an upper GI scheduled next week & hoping for answers.

I’ve had CT scans, ultrasounds, pelvic ultrasounds, and I don’t have my gallbladder. I’ve also tried the chiropractor. I haven’t had issues since losing 35 lbs until yesterday.

I can so relate to most everyone’s symptoms on here but I thought I’d respond to you because yours was the newest post. Your symptoms are so much like mine. It does feel like when I was pregnant and my baby was pushing against my ribs. I also have all the Charlie horse like catches in that area. And tonight I just feel sick. I’ve dealt with this off and on for years but this time it’s lasted for about 3 months with different degrees of pressure. Tonight’s was the worst. My dr did a urine test-normal and liver function test-normal. I go in this Friday February 16th for a Ct scan with contrast. I had my gallbladder out in 1998 so I know it’s not that. I have sjogrens and deal with reflux off and on but usuall my daily prescribed Prilosec takes care of that. But tonight I’ve had heartburn along with all this pressure. So I’m not sure what it is and after reading this whole thread, I don’t feel hopeful I’ll find out. I have been gluten free for years which really helped with stomach issues and reflux. I just recently stopped consuming dairy to see if that would help but so far no. So anyways I’d like to find answers so please keep me updated on how you are doing.",5,3

He can see if you have MALS just from the scan. Slipped Rib Syndrome is trickier - it does not show up in xrays and most scans. sometimes they can determine which ribs are slipped in an ultrasound. My chiropractor was excellent and found which ribs were slipped through multiple visits. she could set them back in place, but, then they would slip back out of place within a few days. Dr Kimberly Krug in New Canaan, CT. I would not recommend the surgeon who performed the rib removal as his follow up care was poor and even after going to him multiple times he missed a staph infection after surgery which delayed the healing process a few months.

Does anyone else get needle like pain????  Doesn't seem like gallbladder - I know I don't have stones per last ultrasound.,5,3
"I don't get any needle like pain, just the same symptoms that kit4410 described. Sounds like several people are experiencing something like this. Wish any of us had a clear diagnosis!",2,1
Please get the bug H Pylori Bacteria checked out my symptoms are so simular to yours I have had it off and on 2 years At last they discovered the problem My problem is I am allergic to antibiotics so they are working out how to deal with me,5,3
"I get the needle pain. Today it's bad. When I rubbed the area, I felt a hard lump. First time I have felt a lump. Mine feels like its numb with pins and needles. About 2"" below center of bottom right ribcage. Had endoscopy, ultrasound, swallowing test, colonoscopy, another test where they inject me with a dye that makes you want to pee. Then they do a CT scan to see if you have any blockages. All my tests came back normal. I am stumped. I am 55, don't drink at all, but do drink a lot of Diet Mountain Dew. Like 5 a day. I am a smoker. Taking Zyban and my quit day is in 8 days. I gained 100 pounds recently. The first 40 I don't know how. My Dr said to go to the gym. There was something wrong and he blew me off. Than I got depressed about the weight gain bc I was anal about what I ate and I worked out twice a day. Was doing 300 crunches a day. And the more I gained, the more depressed I got. So I quit working out, than quit being so anal about what I ate. Now I'm 240 pounds. Was 136 about 3 years ago. But I am stumped about this pain. It is a very wierd sensation. Almost like when the dentist numbs your mouth, and the numbness starts going away. Pins and needles.",5,3
"That stinks Mary, I'm sorry! First of all, it sounds like you may need a new doctor.",0,0
I first noticed the same sensation (numbness/tingling) while I was pregnant. My OBGYN said it's very common because your abdomen grows and it puts pressure on a muscle that pinches a nerve and causes the numb sensation. I wonder if weight gain is presenting a similar challenge.,5,3
"I would recommend an MRI. If it helps, I have gone through all the tests and even found benign spots on my liver. When I went to see a liver specialist he said 30 years ago when people had issues like this, they would do exploratory surgery and most usually would find nothing. Unfortunately he said it may just be something we live with, as long as we can rule out the dangerous stuff.",5,3

"Yes!  My thoughts too. I've been adjusted with ribs out of place t11-t12. Plus muscle relaxers when I feel the spasm pain in my rib like something is jammed up in them. I've also had the fluttering feeling, along with pain and severe bloating. My chiro always seems to make it feel much better, until I lift something or pull it back out of place again.",5,3
"Hi all, I suffer the same problems as most people on this thread. Right rib/back pain, baby moving sensation, bra uncomfortable and stomach pain, bloating and burping. At times it feels like someone is pushing and pushing their fist into my side.",4.333333333,3
I have had an upper GI Scan and endoscopy. The upper Gi Scan was clear but the endoscopy showed erosive gastritis for which I am having treatment and my current stomach problems are improving but the rib pain remains.,5,3
Now the interesting bit - I’ve  been attending a pain clinic because of pain from recent lumbar and cervical surgeries and I’m having treatment from  a physiotherapist. I mentioned my rib/back pain and he has been manipulating my thoracic spine.,5,3
When he pushes against certain vertebrae I feel the familiar pain around my ribs/back and for me that confirms the problem is with the thoracic spine. I have had six treatments and have exercises to do at home and I am slowly improving.,5,3
I do think my rib pain is from bad posture. I like many people have worked at a computer for years and use one at home along with constantly checking my mobile.,3.666666667,2
It’s not going to be a quick fix but already the pain is not so severe an I am having periods when I’m pain free in that area.,3,2

So last night I was sitting here watching a movie leaning back a bit and I could feel the pressure building and the pain intensifying.... Probably the worst it's ever been. Took my breath away and made me nauseous. And this all came on in a matter of minutes. And they I felt this strange sensation like something moved inside of me and the pain and pressure was almost gone... Anyone?,3.666666667,2
Ever got any answers?  Similar to me,0,0
Never.... I'm a 51 year old female with no uterus I still have both ovaries. I know it's impossible for me to be pregnant. I have had ultrasound cat scan mri... I have small complex cyst on my liver and cyst on both kidney.. But nothing to explain this feeling.... It really feels like when I was pregnant and the baby would get up under my rib... However the pain and pressure is magnified by 10....and sometimes I swear I can even feel something move... This started about a year ago and is progressively getting worse,5,3
"It seems so bizarre to me that so many of us have similar symptoms, but  very few have had clear diagnosis of the problem. Several of us, including me, have mentioned it feeling like a baby kicking. Are we all females? Wondering if it could be a reproductive organ issue.",3,2
I don't see any correlation with reproductive organs just because they are positioned so low in our pelvic area and the issue is so high up by the diaphragm. I have read some post from men as well so it does not seem to be gender specific. I'm at a loss. However I do plan on sharing this group discussion with my Gastrointerologist. It IS NOT my imagination,5,3

"If nothing comes back, I wonder if it would be from my thoracic spine T5-T6 bone spur pressing on spinal cord (seen on MRI), or IBS, or adhesions from scar tissues from the surgeries? when straining for BM, I also feel a twist in there",5,3
"I have the exact symptoms as Kit.  Have had them for 3 years.  Mine started with the fluttering sensation when I would laugh hard or bend over. Then it started feeling tender after eating a large meal, the same as i felt when pregnant like a pressure causing the soreness. But not painful. Now I feel some soreness in my back occasionally on the same right side. I don't really have the fluttering anymore but the past couple of weeks when I twist or bend a certain way  or slouch down the exact same spot will have a burning or stinging sensation that just lasts a few seconds.   I had bloodwork and ultrasound about a year ago and they didn't find anything. I am not overweight but I do have a desk job so I sit alot. I do exercise almost everyday.... walking, treadmill, elliptical and a recumbant bike. I have wondered if it has to do with my posture sitting at desk on computer. I do sort of lean to the right side using the mouse.  Or maybe hormones? I am 50.",5,3
I blame a lot of things on meno - i'm 60 and have been suffering with menopause for over 10 yrs.  I try to exercise as much as I can also and my PT person thinks this is scoliosis and bad posture for many yrs.  many yrs at a deskjob also.  I still don't know what I have.,5,3
"So I found this thread and want to say I have the same problems and tried talking to my doctor about it, but he said it was nothing.  I just tried to some ab workouts and I feel a tightness and pain as if something is tearing on my right rib.  There almost feels like a constant tightness on the right side.  The doctor checked my gallbladder and liver through ultrasound and found nothing.  I don't know what to do and I want to workout, but not if it will keep causing this pain",5,3
Has anyone found out what’s causing this pressure. I see a lot of us have the same conditions and have had the same test. But has anyone found the relief for it. Planning on gallbladder surgery soon. They have not even though they have not found anything wrong with it. Look forward to hearing. Thank you,5,3
I have been taking a Zantac 150 twice a day. Morning and about an hour before bedtime. It has helped me tremendously. I still occasionally feel a little twinge if I eat a large meal.,5,3
"Please do not have your gallbladder removed unless you are positive it is non-functioning.  You'll have more problems, if you do.  I have not seen an answer to the issues the people on this forum are having.  I have had it for almost 10 years.  It started as a stabbing pain when I bent over to tie my shoes.  It has now moved on to a terrible muscle spasm that is relieved by standing up as straight as I can and trying to relax.  I definitely believe it is positional (any type of bending wrong at the waist) and I try my best to not do anything that puts me into that position.  I guess you would call it ""guarded.""  First doctor thought it was a floating rib, the second thought it was my gallbladder.  I'm not sure what it is, other than it's painful.  I now eat better sticking to light meals of fruits, vegetables and lean meat.  I do my best not to overindulge because it worsens the problem, in my experience.  It probably isn't life threatening since I have dealt with it for so long.  Good Luck!",5,3
Exactly what I have heard.  Even if it's low functioning best not to have it out unless it's really bad.  I don't want mine out.  I haven't had a hida scan yet.  I still have a feeling this is my thoracic spine - I get pain back there and in ribs in front.  I don't eat a lot of fat either.,3.333333333,2

wow sounds like me but mine is on the  right side for two years now.  Went to primary other day for ortho referral but prob won't tell me anything either.  xray of thoracic spine shows some minor bone spurs and some osteopenia and she said prob wouldnt' cause pain.  grrrr.   I read spurs can press on nerves.  Everyone tellsme mRI probably won't show any anything.  I have a gastro followup next month but this doesn't seem related to food intake.

"So frustrating!! My dr. Thinks I hurt in too many places at random for it to be serious. Shrugs and says ""sorry""! I'm 66 and had heart checked, bloodwork. And all was okay. I have some acid reflux according to him, but it is random also. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia several years ago, and he thinks I have costochondritis. When I ask what I can do, I get another shrug! I had been taking vicodin for several years but he has stopped all opiates to his patients due to the US war on opiates. So I get a ""sorry""! I didn't think vicodin helped much until I stopped it!lol Over three months now and I found out what pain was!  Anyway, I wonder if anyone has mentioned costo to you??",5,3
My original DR did say Costo but I knew that was a crap diagnosis when he said it. The pain was not in the correct location and the symptoms didn't fit. I switched doctors not long after that and got off narcotic pain meds. My new doctor put me on AMITRIPTYLINE which has worked so much better than anything else for my pain.,5,3

"Hi, I came across your post and was wondering if you got any answers? I am a 46 year old female with the same feeling. I know it's not my gallbladder because that was removed over 2 years ago. I was recently diagnosed with celiac artery compression syndrome. I had surgery to fix that and felt better for about 3 weeks. Then the feeling under my rib came back. I've had practically every test known to man and they never show anything. I'm wondering if it may be an epigastric hernia. That's my next thing to check. It feels like when I was in the last months of pregnancy and the baby would put their feet under my ribs. That's the only way I can explain it. Hoping for answers.",5,3

"Hi, I just got off the phone with my general surgeon that preformed my 2 surgeries last month. I vaguely remember him telling me after the first surgery that he had found a hernia around my stomach and esophagus and that he had repaired it. So for the next 3 weeks I didn't have any of the pain or pressure under my right rib. I thought it was fixed. About 2 days ago the pressure returned just as before, feeling like a baby had their feet underneath my ribs. I called the general surgeon to ask him about the first surgery and if he actually repaired the hernia or just pushed it back in place. They said he ""repaired"" it. He did say that I have what's called paraesophageal hernia or hiatal hernia. Those most likely could cause the pressure under my rib. He said to give it a few more weeks to see if it resolves and he'll check it when I come in for my next appointment with him. In my opinion whatever he did to repair the hernia did not work and it has returned. I'm not in any pain it's just a lot of pressure and it's very uncomfortable. Just trying to put it out there that maybe you should go to a gastroenterologist and have them do a test for paraesophageal hernia or hiatal hernia. I hope this helps.",5,3
no answers here yet either.  Everyone thinks it's muscular/Skeletal.  Finally went to gastro yesterday and had a long talk.  She doesn't think it's gastro but if it was low functioning GB they don't usually remove them anyway,4.666666667,3

"Hi Kit, Did you find an answer to your symptoms?   For the last several years I have pain under my right rib cage.  I also feel like something is stuck there and have right back and shoulder pain.

It stops me in my tracks and I have to do the quick breathing like I'm in labor and wait for it to go away.

"Do you vape?   I made a comment asking for the same help or updates on this forum somewhere but I can't find it now to update.  I actually went to urgent care with this pain recently.  Once again they couldn't find anything wrong with my gall bladder, liver, appendix.  On this trip though they told me that I had calcium spots on my pancreas.  After a lot of reading I came across articles on how nicotine (not cigarettes) can cause the pancreas to have too much calcium.  The pancreas can cause pain.  I don't know if links are allowed but here goes.....https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12094008 ;   If I think about it.... the pain started shortly after I started vaping about a year and a half ago.  So then I noticed that there are tons of people on vaping forums that have these symptoms.  Even their doctors are telling them that vaping shouldn't have anything to do with it but I'm not so sure.  It's pretty close to Christmas so I won't see my own Dr. until after.  So I'm going to try to stop vaping and see if the pain goes away.  I love vaping so this isn't going to be fun.

"Started on 10mg cit 2 weeks ago have dropped to 5 mg as really racked up anxiety.

This is just my opinion but if the suggested therapeutic dose starts at 20mg then that is the lowest dose that you should be working up to.,0,0
"As anxiety is a side effect it's hard to know if the symptoms are of your mental health difficulty or side effects but I've always started on 20mg (albeit with side effects for the first few weeks) and then gone up to 40mg if I'm super bad.

The maximum i can take is 20 at my age so certainly wouldn't be able to start that high. I started on 5 then when i raised to 10 racked up symptoms then eased when i lowered. Think some are more sensitive than others. I took really low dose of zopiclone but it was effective.,4.666666667,3

Copied from Eileen's post in another discussion.,0,0
"A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to. As it did for several ladies beforehand.",5,3
My reductions are VERY slow. I use the following pattern to reduce each 1mg:,5,3
"1 day new dose, 6 days old dose",1.66,1
"By that stage if I feel OK I feel safe to go all new dose. I suppose you might be OK starting and stopping at ""1 day new, 4 days old"" but I was terribly sensitive to steroid withdrawal pain so I err on the safe side. Once you get to the ""everyday new dose"" - if you feel OK you can start on the next reduction, no real need to spend a month at the new dose.",5,3
"This avoids steroid withdrawal pain - which is so similar to PMR pain that you often can't tell which is which and some of us suspect that many flares are NOT the PMR returning but problems with steroid withdrawal. Using a scheme like this also means you can stop immediately if you have any problems - you might be fine at one day old dose, 2 days new (lower) dose but not at a 3 day gap - but you have dropped your dose a lot and that is the idea. It also isn't as slow as you would think - you can reduce at a rate of about 1mg/month on a continual basis.",1.66,1
"The Bristol group start new patients with PMR with 6 weeks 15mg, 6 weeks at 12.5mg and then a year at 10mg before continuing the reduction and that achieves a far lower rate of flare (20% instead of 60%) and I suspect their flares then come below 10mg as they then do the 1mg at a time reduction. Just below 10mg is a common dose for people to get stuck at - and I (and others) believe it is because even 10% drops are too much for many patients. These patients are then labelled as ""steroid resistant"" or told they need methotrexate to help them reduce but we have seen this slow reduction work for those patients too. We believe that methotrexate (MTX) works for patients who have late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) or LORA and PMR together. Very few patients get off pred altogether when taking the MTX - those who do are probably the mis-diagnosed LORA patients - or another arthritis that responds to MTX.""",0,0

Can I add a codicil to the very slow reduction plan in the above post:,0.333333333,0
"When you are at doses below 5mg it is a good idea to rest at each new dose for a month at least before trying the next reduction. At this point you risk overshooting the dose that is controlling the inflammation so waiting a short time to see if symptoms reappear is helpful. If you just continue there is a possibility that you get to very slightly below the ""right dose"" and inflammation will start to reappear very slowly. The blood tests will lag even further behind the dose reduction - there must be enough inflammation to increases the proteins being measured for the blood tests to rise.",0,0
Someone has asked this question:,0,0
"""I'm at 7mg going down to 6mg, and I'm at the point where I'm starting to shift from more 6mg than 7mg, but I can tell the pain is returning. So...do I jump up big to say 10mg, or try 7mg or 8mg? I hate the very idea of going up at all, but it is what it is.""",5,3
My reply was:,0,0
"No - you go back to the last dose that worked well immediately and stop the reduction. This isn't a ""flare"", this is your body telling you that you have got to the dose you are looking for: the LOWEST DOSE THAT MANAGES THE SYMPTOMS. It doesn't mean you won't get lower, it just means not yet. However slowly you reduce, whatever scheme you use, you will not get below that dose without a return of symptoms because of left-over inflammation that hasn't been removed by the amount of pred you took. It is if you ignore these warnings that you will allow a build-up of the inflammation to the stage where you will have a flare on your hands.",0,0
To comment on something someone else said - you have differentiated between steroid withdrawal and a return of symptoms by using DSNS. If you were going to suffer with steroid withdrawal you will notice it the first day you use the new lower dose. That is the idea of DSNS - you go back to the dose your body is happy at for a few days and then show the new dose to your body again. For me it usually takes about 3 times for my body to accept the new lower dose and stop complaining.,5,3

Cramps in my legs in my hamstrings have woken me up 230 am. Once that subsided it move to the side of my leg and i couldnt straighten them for at least 3-4 minutes. Thats the longest ive had to endure any sort of cramps before!! Ive recently four days ago reduced my prednisone from 20 mgs to 16mgs . Does anybody think this is prednisone related or unrelated? Ive had pmr for only 4 months and im a 54 yr old male.I started back at work 11 days ago at my occupation as a knifehand at the meatworks. Was on 20 mgs for around 3 months .,5,3

I had cramps in my right calf last night it woke me up I couldn't straighten my leg for a few minutes had to rub it hard to get rid of the cramp I've never had cramp before last night was the first time I got it I hope I never get it again,3.333333333,2
"Hello Maurice, I too suffer very badly from cramp in my legs when I sit too long or very early in the mornig. It is extremely painful and I have to get up and wiggle my legs and walk about. It certainly makes a very disturbed night. A friend's doctor told her that Zinc if the answer for cramp. And indeed every night now I take  Zinc, Magnesium and potassium. At first it gave me pain free nights for about a month but latterly I've been bothered a bit with the return of cramp, but not as bad as it was. So I suggest you get yourself some zInc and try that. Hopefully it will have the same positive effect. I only hope I'll continue to sleep through the nights without doing my midnight wiggle!!!! I had wondered above Vascillitus!! Hope I spelt that correctly. Also wondered if this cramp In the legs is associated with PMR which the docs believe I have.",5,3
"Hello Maurice, I too suffer from night leg cramps, but have the answer for me. Tonic water every day, 200ml if Fever Tree brand. If I use the cheaper tonic water sold in the big stores I need a good glass full. I understand it's the quinine that does the trick. I've had restful nights for over six months now since trying out the tonic water. It works for me and I would encourage you to try it. I've read it doesn't work for everyone, but I for one, know in the night if I forget to take my glass a day!  Good luck!",4.333333333,3

Hello ​Ive been on prednisolone for 4 years now Im down to 5mg but struggling to get lower. Am I right in thinking the theory is to do the slow method to 41/2 mg then stay on this a month and then start again if ok. Could do with some advice.,5,3
"When you say you are struggling does that mean you are in pain? If so,  has that been just recently? Did it follow your latest reduction?",0,0
You are down to a low dose and a stage that has given many of us trouble. I stayed there for three months as directed by GP and only tried to get lower if I was completely comfortable.,5,3
Also it is often recommended that you do not reduce by more than 10% so that means cutting your pills ( as long as they are not the coated ones ). Alternatively you can reduce in tiny steps by perhaps reducing to the next level on alternate days or spacing the reductions even less frequently.... as one day a week then the lower dose twice a week and so on.,0,0
You may not find this necessary but what is essential is not to reduce while in pain because you'll only find yourself back on a higher dose.,0,0
It took me five years but I did get there and have been symptom free for more than three years. Good luck!,3.333333333,2
Hi Emis I am going to try reducing but am starting from 25mg. Every time I try to reduce to 20mg the pain comes back. Today I got some 1mg tablets so hope to start the slow reduction process. It is going to take a long time but at the moment I am not getting away from 25 anyway. Are many people starting from such a high dose? It sounds impossible to get down under 10mg. It would be good to hear if anyone starting a 1mg reduction from 25 did get down to a very small dose.,5,3
"I began at 20MG and reduced 2.5MG per month. (For example, 17.5MG second month, 15MG third month, 12.5MG fourth month, 10MG fifth month - January 2017).",4.666666667,3
"February 2017 I will take 9MG, March 2017 I will take 8MG. Doc prescribes 5MG pills and 1MG pills. So February I take one 5MG and four 2MG tablets daily. So far no flares. I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop though.",5,3
"Have been on a steady reduction rate from15mg of prednisolone from last March until two weeks ago, mid Jan./17 I had been on 1 mg for the last month, then I was taken off steroids. Within five or six days my shoulders stiffened up again, I am back on 2 mg of steroid and do not feel as good as I was on 1mg. Maybe a maintenance dose of 1 mg would have been better. I advise caution to anyone coming off 1mg",5,3
"You would be extremely lucky if you are off within a year?   Ten months from 15 mg to zero is very fast!   I'm male and started, as a very active 74 year old some 2.5 years ago, at 30 mg and have only just reached zero. I'm considered a fortunate one.",4.666666667,3

"I have been on Prednisolone since 2007 since my GP diagnosed my aching legs and arms due to PMR. Initially on 15mg dose the pains disappeared quickly  and after a month I was down to 10mg. After 12 months this was deduced to 7.5 then after a year to 5mg. I have been trying to get the dose down since then. In September last year I was on 4mg and appart from a little acid reflux I was in no serious discomfort with minor stiffness. This year I have been making more effort to reduce my dependance on Prednisolone, and reduced to 3mg. I had a bone scan and was diagnosed with Osteopenea, my GP put me on Adcal vitamin D3 and calcium. I reduced Prednisolone to 2mg but the PMR  symptoms came back with a vengence. I have had severe body stiffness in legs and upper arms and hands, and been feeling very weak but have tried to do as much exercise as possible walking mainly.  The stiffness in back arms and legs is worse first thing in the morning for an hour or two. Taking Paracetamol helps to aleviate the pains. I am reluctant to go back on a higher dose of Prednisolone but may have to go up to 4mg. I am seeing my GP next week to discuss.",5,3
"If you were comfortable on 3mgs. I think I'd stay there or even, if necessary, increase up to 5 to have decent quality of life. Lots of us have found 5 a bit of a sticking point and several are happy to stay there for life if necessary.. Ten years may feel like a life sentence especially if, like me, you are not keen on drugs but so is the pain of PMR a life sentence, isn't it?",3,2

Thank you for your reply. I am fortunate I have a sympathetic GP who has already said I may need to remain on a low dose of steride.

Appart from the stiffness I feel OK and at 77yrs that cant be bad.,5,3

Hello and thank you again for sharing this very helpful post. I read it sometime ago but couldn't find it s second time but wanted to try to help my monther reduce her current steroid dose. She is also on MXT and has had  both medicines for the last two years.

A little background--I feel pretty miserable most of the time, especially mornings, then I perk up a little in the afternoons.  Diagnosed with poly last September, started pred in October. Thanks!

"My next question- we are going to Florence, Italy for 2 weeks in December- there is a 5 hour time difference. If I take the prednisone at the same USA time every day (6:30 AM USA is 11:30 AM ITALY) is that early enough in the day? If I switch to 6:30 AM Italy time, that is 1:30 AM USA time.

To my delight and his interest it worked and I remember him saying "" I'll note that for future reference"". I continued to take them at night until I got to zero and the unwanted symptoms did not return. It did not affect my sleep.",5,3

I have a regularly scheduled doctor's visit in a couple of weeks, but I believe I've figured out that prednisone is in my case due to stress.  When I first began prednisone because of all-over pain, my son had just been diagnosed with a terminal disease.  Now, as I said, I am way down to just 2 mg a day and today the all-over pain came back and - guess what - most extreme stress ever in my life now with my precious son dying.

As I have been on steroids since 2011 and have had 3 serious flare ups with the resultant rise in steroid doses and the harsh reduction programme that follows  I think I will give the DSNS method a try as the rheumatology clinic I go to twice a year is very keen to put me on Methotrexate and I am not keen to do that.

"Hello all, very interesting looking at the various experiences.  So, here's mine.  Diagnosed with PMR (but no GCA!) last September.  SED rate was over 130.  So bad it kicked an elevated heart enzyme, and they first thought I had a mild heart attack.  Luckily, doctors diagnosed the PMR in about 2 weeks.  Lost about 25 lbs. in that short time.  Started with a huge injection of Pred, then to 40 to 20 to 10 tablets.  Since then, we gone down 1 per month, and I'm at 6.  Once I go to 5, they will slow it down even more by going down 1 every 2-3 months.  So far, so good.  Hard to distinguish any muscle pain or stiffness with physical activity - like going to the gym, etc.  From this discussion, it sounds like I will really find out where I am with this when I get under 5mg.  Although, the slow rate they're taking through may be the best approach.  Also, take calcium and D supplements.  All blood work looks good. Weight gain is very frustrating...  When people say debilitating, I totally get it!  Worst illness experience ever.  I'm pretty pain tolerant - but this was horrible...",5,3
"This is an interesting discussion and one that I probable should have applied to myself. My inflammation, which is measured by: Erythrocyte Sediment Rate was in February 24mm when on 3mg of Prednislone. I had no feelings of  pain or stiffness, this only occurred on 1mg. Since finishing it has increased to 27mm. So in theory I should re introduce the Pred to 3mg and then apply the slow taper",5,3
"This topic is very interesting and I would be very interested in doing this method but one thing worries me.....I have read lots of posts on this forum and other forums for FMR/GCA where people are upping and lowering their doses of Pred, are they doing this with their Rheumy's/GP's knowledge and agreement or are they doing it by themselves?",0,0
"I am seeing my Rheumy in a weeks time and will ask her about this method as I have gotten down to 12.5mg from 20mg but the symptoms returned almost immediately so I went back up to 15mg every other day and this seems to work (even though I don't like doing it without GP/Rheumy backing), I don't think that it is withdrawal from the Pred causing the symptoms though. Hopefully she will agree that this method will be of benefit to me so that I can try it at least, I'm not sure what I'll do if she doesn't because I don't think I could put up with the pain it's causing (I'm disabled and am in pain 24/7 because of it so any extra pain makes life pretty hard to say the least!)",5,3
"It would be wise for you to copy and paste your question into a new post as this will only be seen by a very few people followng the old thread.  If the symptoms returned immediately they could have been withdrawal, but a drop of 2.5 makes it difficult to know exactly how much more you may need.  Are you taking 12.5 one day and 15 in between?  Are you able to get 1 mg tablets, it makes it easier to drop in smaller steps.",0,0

"To answer your question, yes I am taking 12.5mg one day and 15mg the next and so on. I could probably get 1mg tablets if I asked my GP but knowing him he will probably read me the riot act (in a nice way) for meddling with the dosage  without talking to him or my Rheumy! lol  As I said in my last post, I'm due to see my Rheumy soon so will take it up with her.",5,3

Phew, it doesn't rain but pours eh!!! :-)",5,3
"I was on 20mg of Prednisone to begin. Stayed there about a month. Then I began the DSNS method with my Rheumy’s approval. I never missed a dose and dropped all the way down to 3mg before I thought some pain was returning. He said that in his experience, 3 or 4 mg is about the spot for trouble if one is going to have any. My Rheumy was adamant about only going back up to the LEAST possible dose that would stop the pain. I only went up 2mg and resumed the DSNS method from that level. I had PMR from June 2016 to June 2018. I think this method allowed my adrenals to resume working slowly while controlling the pain. Knock on wood, I am still pain free. My Rheumy monitored my blood work every 3 months. The SED rate, and the other one I can’t recall right now, fell slowly and steadily back to normal. He did a bone scan in 2017 and again in 2018. I had no bone loss! Which is amazing for my age, 67. I went to OsteoStrong, osteogenic loading, weekly and took Vitamin D3 and calcium supplements throughout. I had no other diseases or disorders other than PMR. There, I think you have it all. Always follow your Doctor’s advice??",5,3
"I'm sorry to hear this.  Wouldn't prednisone also help the pulmonary fibrosis, however?  In which case maybe it's too soon to be tapering at all, let alone by these large steps.  But I really don't know, I have no medical training, but maybe a question to ask the doctor.",0,0
"If you are concerned about changing your dose without the knowledge of your rheumy., what I do is contact his/her office, and leave a message regarding what I have done and why. Then if they are unhappy with what you are doing they can call you or give you an appointment to go in. I have not had any problems with this and have perhaps done it twice in one year.",4,3
I am on a reducing dose of steroids and I am down to 8 mg a day. I have just had a bad cold and I am now suffering a lot of pain.  Would this cold have caused my polymyalgia to flare up and do I need to return to the higher dose,5,3

Finally went to an endocrinologist and she quickly said I had adrenal insufficiency from coming off the prednisone too quickly after the surgery.

"""A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer).

I wonder if I should be staying at home - I just don't like to let others down. 8 mgs is almost the same as my body would produce so maybe I am not immunosuppressed??? Any thoughts please?",5,3
"I've read so many posts lately that I can't give the exact details of what I read, but in the last couple days I saw that a highly-placed rheumy in England spoke of 10 mg as being the dose to be below.

"Yes ,It is an immunosuppressant & I'm down to 4.5mgs.after going down very slowly for 2.5 years. I got the 2 worst flu viruses of my life in Oct. & in early Jan. along with a strange illness that attacked my nerves for 33 days with excruciating ,electrical shock like stabbing pains in my chest,back,& then up in my head & at times it was shocking me every 5 seconds.The E.R.doctor said he had heard of other patients with the same thing but they don't know what it is. When I got the 2 flu viruses my lungs were filling up so fast that I thought I was going to drown & the antibiotics worked for only a few days at the end of the week that I was on them & the infection in my lungs came back within 2 to 3 days both times & lasted for 2 months each.I was on 4 other medications during this time also. I got several skin cancers burned off my arms & one on my leg last year & they all got so infected which isn't the norm for my arms. My rheumatologist & primary dr. both said that even though I'm down to 4.5mgs that I have little immune system left . SO SCARY !

"There is so much they don’t know about the medications they prescribe and a lot more they don’t tell us. I went from 15mls down to zero of PREDNISONE and PREDNISOLONE. I got conflicting answers on the difference between the two and why rheumatologist and GP kept changing from one to the other and back. With the Covid-19 now I wonder if the PMR or medication has affected my immune system now both have ceased. I am a 77 y/o male with Type2 diabetes, elevated BP and long-term congestion issues. My daily medications include twice the standard dose of Lercanidipine (Zanidip) = 20mg I received advice from a GP that BP medications especially Lercanidipine act as a receptor for Covid-19 and substantially increase the risk of infection. My GP has received no advice in this regard. The disparity between Corona’s severity between age groups could have more to do with our medications than just our age. We don’t know how any of our medications affect our immune system now or down the track. Our individual system is a work in progress for each of us. Covid-19 once in our system will likely leave an immunity against re-infection but possibly for a short time. Like the common cold it could keep happening with these more serious ramifications.",5,3

What is fairly certain is that your PMR plus diabetes and raised BP and age would increase risks but if you are no longer on pred that improves the risk of contracting CV in the first place. But the other risk factors do require you should self-isolate and are consistent about avoiding other people. Your age and comorbidities will make management more difficult if you were to get it. So you should be concentrating on avoiding contracting Covid 19,0,0

Some people can get up to a years relief, some much shorter, but to my mind, worth trying. I would be concerned that the doctor only prescribed 4.5 mgs of Pred, as this doesn't allow for the DSNS system of reducing, which at that level would be very important to do, going straight to 4.5mg could cause problems, he needs a bit of wriggle room, maybe a phone call to the doctor to at least send an amended prescription of 5mgs.

I only had PMR but a friend had GCA ( no PMR ) and was started on 60 mg. He was an electrician so sight very important. He continued to work throughout his treatment which lasted about three or four years ( would have to check that ) and made a complete recovery with no recurrence.

If 2 or 3 mg work for you it should not be compromising your immune system. Even if you need 5 mg for a week or so you should be fine.

I'll go ahead and take 2 mg more and stay with 5 mg for at least a few days.",5,3
"Yeah Mich, my rheumatologist was skeptical that I even had PMR. I was already on prednisone before I saw her, so I had no symptoms and inflammation markers were zero. I knew this was not just old-age stiffness and soreness. It came on quick and severe a year ago. My GP was on it though.",5,3

My response to that was to even lower my carb intake more. This helped a lot and now in March, I am still careful with carb intake but a little more relaxed. The PMR, I feel, is not gone but can't get a grip on me either. I have full range of motion in my limbs. only my neck gets sore if I am at the computer too long.

Do not reduce your Prednisone dosage if you have any PMR pain. Have a bone density scan, so you know the conditions of your bones. Look into taking Calcium, Magnesium, vitamin K2 and MSM for bone health. The side effects of Prednisone are not pleasant, but it controls the inflammation, which must be controlled.

"Hi Clicklaura, I have found with a flare that I have been to up my dosage double, then triple for 3 or 4 days. Then reverse the amount and days on the same schedule as I increased. Stopping the flare and getting the inflammation under control. Unfortunately I have had too many flares in the almost four of my PMR journey. My first bad flare was not controlled and I increased from 7mg to 30mg in very small long increases. I have been taper from that experience 3 years in May. We are all individuals each case is different. DSNS method works that is one thing I believe is true for everyone. Good luck!🙂",5,3

"Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with PMR 4 weeks ago. My rheumatologist put me on 20 mg of prednisone for 4 weeks, reducing to 15 mg , then to 5 mg until I return for my next visit in April. Last night I had severe leg cramps, Not just in the calves, but my entire leg. I have never had this before. Is this a side effect of the Prednisone? Before being diagnosed, I was in severe pain with major stiffness in pretty much all my joints. Very difficult to get out of bed and walk in the mornings. I just thought it was old age. I have always been a fairly active woman, and considered myself a young 67. But by the time I was 68, I felt I had aged 10 years. After 1 week on the prednisone I felt like a new woman. I don't feel quite as good now as I did 3 weeks ago, and will start reducing my dosage today. Is that normal? The information on this site has been so helpful. Thanks in advance for any information you my have on this matter.",5,3
I have PRM and GCA my dr ordered me to take 550 mg potassium daily with my pred. I have done so and only had leg cramps once in 6 years of treatment.,5,3
"Hi Collen, I used to get cramps but i have been taking Magnesium for the last 5months and have only had it once since, do try it. Good Luck",5,3
The first thing to try for the cramp is magnesium - pred makes you lose more magnesium through the urine. I'd be wary of taking more potassium without having had blood tests and medical advice.- too much potassium is dangerous. But you can increase the amount you eat of foods with plenty of potassium such as:,2,1

"Because you felt so much better did you try to go back to normal activity levels? The pred has cured nothing - it just relieves the inflammation caused by the underlying autoimmune disorder that causes it and that leaves the actual illness chugging along in the background, attacking the muscles and leaving them intolerant of acute exercise. If you do too much you will develop DOMS, delayed onset muscle soreness, as if you had done far too much exercise, and it will take much longer than usual to resolve.",1.66,1
"Thanks. I started taking magnesium today. And yes, I did go back to my original activity level. My shoulders and knees are more painful than 3 weeks ago. I felt so good that I did not think about still having the disease and the prednisone is really just keeping it under better control. I will have to be more mindful if that.",5,3
It is a mistake almost everyone makes at some point! You will get the hang of it eventually.,0,0
This is not an answer for the cramps but an answer concerning the reduction. I speak from experience. Reducing by 5 mg at a time is risky as the PMR will flare right up again. I started by reducing 2.5 mg then by 1 mg and both times when I hit the 12 to 10 mg mark my pain returned.,4.666666667,3
I am now reducing by .5 mg via DSNS and am at almost 10 mg without pain. Also I split the dose to half in the morning and half at night as I found taking it all in the morning did no work as each morning I was very stiff and sore until about noon.,4.666666667,3

i found a web site called point of no return it mentions 10% tapering and taking omega 3 oils so going to speak to my gp and try getting the drug in liquid form as will help with the tapering and makes it easier.,5,3
I had no idea that it was available as a liquid. I'm surprised that Tomatom was cutting tablets in half as they are available in 5mg. which is what mine are.,3,2
don't be worried. I've heard on other forums that some people have come off with no problems at all. Just don't rush it. I've realised that because I've been on this small dose for some years I need to take things much slower. All the best everyone.,4,3

The main thing I'm noticing so far is that it's a bit harder to get to sleep and I'm waking a bit earlier which is actually a good thing. On the higher doses I needed 9-12hrs a night so less is good,4,3

Headaches will cease. It happened to me before. I hope you can get off very very slowly with minimal withdrawal this time.

what do you mean re leg pain? My legs are feeling stiff but my neck has been stiff  since i went down to 10mg so a few months now. Do you think the stiffness is a withdrawal too? x ,5,3
"Amanda thanks for replying, re the leg pain was actually more leg stiffness and felt like you had done a massive workout where you feel really stiff after, weird I know but so glad that has gone but I definitely think it is withdrawal.

I stumbled across your post. I was on amitryptyline 50mg for 20 years. My doctor did a straight swap on to mirtazapine 12 weeks ago. The doc basically told me to cut 50 mg amitryptyline down in 5 days which I now know was a mistake. Wanted I wanted to ask you is could I still be experiencing withdrawals 12 weeks later from stopping the amitryptyline.,5,3
I'm feeling so unwell I'm trying to work out if it's from stopping the amitryptyline or its the mirtazapine doing it. Asked my doctor this same question 4 weeks ago and she said the amitryptyline will be gone. I'm not so sure she seems to think swapping one pill to another should have no ill affects. Told her I wanted off the mirtazapine so she told me her version of withdrawing. Come off it and had 4 days off hell. She didn't even know how for me to taper safely. ,5,3
Went back to see her told her I couldn't stop it dead like that my nervous system was jumping around like playing table tennis. I've lost all faith in doctors giving out but he correct information. Anyway any reply off you I would be most grateful.,4.666666667,3

are palpitations a withdrawal symptom when coming off amitryptiline? i am now on 10mg and have been having them 😕,5,3
I know you said you had neck pain and this drug is used for nerve pain which is often the nature of neck pain. Did you also suffer from anxiety? When you stop taking it you're likely to have a return of your pain because the drug masked the pain but didn't cure the cause,0,0
"If you also had anxieties, withdrawing the drug will allow the anxiety to return also and anxiety can often trigger palpitations as part of what is called a panic attack. If anxiety is an issue for you, that may be all it is. and, if so, then its harmless. If not, then discuss it with your GP.",0,0
i did have anxiety but it was never to the point of panic attacks and before recently i have never had palpitations before. i am thinking/hoping it is a withdrawal symptom and that it will pass. i am going to take the 10mg for a while to get my body used to being on a lower dose. it is crazy what meds can do to you,5,3

"omg exact same with me i was hoping it was going to get better soon , i just cant get to sleep and when i do its only an hour or so when i wake up i am startled i jump out of my skin its very weird. i have tried listening to sleep apps some times it works , have you tried anything ? also doctor gave me some phenergan tablets i only took a quarter of one they made me worse .",5,3
ugh its awful i thought mine would be better by now as well. i saw you took them for anxiety and insomnia... was the insomnia this bad before you took them? i also took them for that reason after a bad reacction to zoloft resulting in extreme anxiery and so then insomnia. my sleep off of it is sooook much worse now. ive never experiencdd such horrific insomnia and quality of sleep. ive tried everything,5,3

I was wondering if i could get some answers as to how long it took you to get over the amitriptyline withdrawl symtoms? I know the amount taken and the amount of time it was taken for plays a large role of this,1,0
"i was on 10mg for around 4 years then 50mg for around 2 years. The VA prescribed this for sleeping. Long story short, I had to stop taking the Amitriptyline abruptly on Febuary 6th, 2019 because it caused my heart to go into V-Tach. So i have been off the drug completely for 5 months. ",5,3
"I am STILL having withdrawl symptoms. The brain zaps, dizziness, hot flashes, constant headaches, body aches, fatigued, no energy. I am sleeping better now, but at first it was horrid. maybe 4 hours a night tops. sometimes only 1. If any of you can share how long it took you to get completely over your withdraws, i would very much appreciate it. thank you",5,3
"i was on 20mgs for 5 years, i also had to stop them suddenly. it wasn't the best experience ive ever had. Mine started to slow down after about 3 months id only feel bad every so often. then it went completely about 4 months.",4.666666667,3
"I'm glad that your doing better now. I am hoping any day now that I will wake up and feel like a brand new person. I remember thats how it was the last time the VA had me on this medicine and I stopped taking it. Felt horrible for months then one day I woke up, and it was completely done.",5,3
"i've decided to come off amytriptyline for fibromyalgia. i've been on 10-20mg for about 2 years. for the first few days of not taking it i kept having dizzy spells and headaches but i didnt feel dazed like i have done since being on it, im managing to sleep ok which is a bonus i didnt expect that because im usually reliant on them for sleep.",5,3
"the most troublesome withdrawal symptom im having is feeling so sick all of the time and the hot sweats, is it likely to stay like this for a while or does it gradually ease off each day? i know its different for every person but the thought if feeling like this for months is making me want to go back on it 😦",4.333333333,3
 i'm glad youve had a few normal months but sorry to hear its come crashing back down on you. ,0,0
"since i first commented my sickness has eased off but the sleeping situation is awful, im so tired in the day but cannot sleep at night but i expected that due to the drug making me so drowsy before. im going to stick to it purely because i dont want to go through those first few days again. i hope your body heals itself quickly for you x",5,3
"chelsey, how are things going with your sleep? i've been dealing with the insomnia after coming off for many months now. Is it improving for you at all? wishing you a speedy recovery",5,3
"hi mary, i have been off amitriptyline for over 2 months now, and my sleeping pattern is near enough back to normal. i do have the odd night here and there where it takes longer to drift off but ive got to the point now where once im asleep im asleep for the night.",5,3
im so happy to hear you are sleeping well and feeling better. good for you! i was on 25mg for a month and then 10mg for a month. ive been off for about 10 months and i'm beginning think the insomnia is permanent now. everyone seems to recover their sleep after several weeks to several months so im just gonna have to find a way to accept it at this point.,5,3

I have booked a well woman appointment for next week and although it will cost me to go private (can't wait for GP dates...too long a wait) I would recommend everyone on this forum to seek medical help to know where to start from as there may be more important underlying problems that need to be addressed.,4,3

Hi Kim are you still experiencing these strange symptoms on your scalp I feel like someone has pulled my hair or I have bumped my head it just feels raw . No pain inside just on the scalp 💕,3.333333333,2
The first year of perimenopause (I didn’t know what it was back then) I had almost daily migraines on one side of head with horrible scalp pain and tenderness. I would also get a really hot face. One of the most difficult times for me. Went on for 6 months. Only came on in afternoons. Scalp pain is a common symptom of migraine and also some types of neuralgia caused by migraine. I’m sorry you are having this! I saw a neuro and had all the tests but decided not to take the migraine meds.,5,3

"thanks everyone, I had a feeling it was due to menopause but thought I'd ask. It is hist another frustrating symptom. Have a great day ladies x",3,2
"I've had this off and on since I started perimenopause (~2 years ago, I am 45). I went to an ENT and was diagnosed with LPR (Silent Reflux). When it happens, I take an omeprazole (Nexium) in the morning as soon as I get up (~1 hour prior to eating) and a famotidine (Pepcid) right before bed. This combination does not work as well as Nexium in the AM and Zantac in the PM, but until the Zantac recall is resolved, I'm out of luck. I'm currently experiencing a pretty bad bout of it and it's so annoying.",5,3
it still surprises me how young some of you ladies start peri/menopause. So many doctors told me I was too young yet i have had symptoms for years and I'm 47 now. I would just like to feel normal again,3.666666667,2
I always feel that way like mucus is stuck in my throat . i am always clearing it. This menopause is driving me crazy and I cant take it any more. I have at lease 80 percent of the symptoms out of the 66 .,5,3
"I agree it is so annoying, why do hormones cause so much havoc on our bodies???",1.333333333,1
"im experiencing it now , feels like i am constantly trying to swallow and take deep breaths as making my chest feel tight so im coughing , which then is making me think its corona virus ! i feel like i have mucus all on my chest and in my throat !",4,3
"im 46 and had alot of peri symtoms although doctors ive seen poo poo this !! im very anxious person anyway and think this isnt helping !im due on in 3 days so thinking is this part of it too , i just dont know what to think anymore ! x",4.666666667,3
"Melissa last week i had a terrible night, heavy breathing, hard to swallow , tight chest, i too thought it was corona. I got up in the night and started pacing frantic, then the anxiety came on. I had to talk my way out of it reassuring myself that i didn't have corona. I then fell on my knees and started to pray.",4,3
P eri and meno can play such mind games especially in this time with corona because the symptoms are similar. symptoms are hardest for me 10 days before my cycle and a week after i am done. So i say that your symptoms are acting up worse because you are close to your date. Stay strong praying for all you and all the ladies.,3.333333333,2

"I have a question, have any of you experienced swelling in your ankles and or feet during your period? I am on day four and I haven't had a period since January. Prior to that I went a whole 100 days without a period. Leading up to this one, my stress and anxiety had hit an all time high with this virus running loose and my kids being home plus the hubby is home too working from home. Usually when he's at work and they're at school, that's my ""me time"". Now, I don't get any of that. But all that aside, my original question was about the swollen ankles. 😂 It's only the left leg. I think I've had this before but every time a symptom disappears and then resurfaces without warning, it feels new. Can anyone relate?",4,3
"hi Sharcerv - i have swollen knees & my left leg overall feels ""puffy"" - actually i would say my whole lower half appears ""puffy"".",4,3
"i have had them ultrasounded & its just fatty deposits, but alarming how it came on overnight.",5,3

Didn't start taking bp meds until peri started. Prior to that my bp was normal.,5,3
"hi - sharcerv - yeah, i hear ya about getting on B/P RX during this Peri/meno journey...its the one thing that went crazy for me too - i would think the RX you are on would keep you from retaining any fluid, but who knows - you may want to contact your dr just to make sure everything is OK",5,3
"i have asked my GP over & over about my leg issues & she referred me to rheumatologist, went to rheumatologist, still no answers so i come back to hormones are causing it - some days worse that others -",5,3
I think it is just my hormones causing this because it has only happened to me once before when I was on my period and that was years ago. It only resurfaced again this time on my period. Today is day 5 and the swelling went away.,3.333333333,2
"I have been on this bp medicine for years and it's never caused this reaction so I don't think it was the medicine. It's just that sometimes these symptoms come and go so randomly that you forget about them until they pop up again like some sick game of ""peek-a-boo.""",5,3

Hello. In January I turned fifty and my whole life changed. I have never felt this in my head and body .,1.333333333,1
"About a year ago I would wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing . I attributed it to stress. In January when I turned fifty, I started to get Palpations and increased heart rate .",4,3
My Blood pressure was a bit high even though i never had a BP issue . I saw my Pcp . They did all these cardiac workups which were all normal. She later prescribed a beta blocker to help with my heart rate and palpitations.,5,3
"I later started noticing i was getting ringing//fullness/pulsation in my left ear would also come with a weird vibration in my body . Sometimes I would think my Bp was high but it was been normal . In addition, I would feel as if my stomach/chest was vibration/pulsating . I would also get a pulling feeling in chest and stomach especially epigastric area . Because of all these feelings it is difficult to sleep .",4,3
"People tell you about common symptoms of peri/menoupause like hot flashes but never these symptoms . Because of these symptoms, i feel as if i am developing anxiety . Anxiety because i don't know what is the cause of all if this .",4.666666667,3
I also saw my Ent who stated that I had a eustachian tube dysfunction however the ear symptoms should have gotten better already . I am now scheduled for an Mri of head focusing on my temporal bone to see if this is a middle ear issue .,5,3
After reading some of the the comments on this site I am left wondering if hormonal changes can really cause all these feelings . I haven't reported any of this to my gynecologist as yet because I wanted to rule out ear issue first .,4.666666667,3
Sometimes I feel like my family and friends may start to think I am crazy . I have never felt like this in my life and just want some relief from all these weird symptoms .,3,2
Do you have a constant ringing all day long? Or are these heart palpitations/surges accompanied with a short sudden ringing in one ear?,0,0
The ringing in the ear is constant . mostly to my left ear . The intensity of it comes and goes . Sometimes when it intensified and i feel the vibration/palpation in my chest and belly I check my pulse (thinking I'm having heart palpations )but it is ok .,4,3
I know what you mean by vibration/palpitation in the chest and belly. Ive been having this for about 2 years now.,4,3
Yes the pulse is always normal thinking its palp but heart rate usually normal. I have no idea what causes this. As soon as I wake up mine usually starts and tends to taper off in the evening. A few doctors say its anxiety or Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,5,3
Thanks for sharing . Did u do anything for the questionable anxiety ie meds/relaxation techniques.,0,0
I sometimes wonder if the stress from my ear problem is leading to anxiety manifesting itself via these vibration/pulling symptoms . I can't even visit a psychotherapist for evaluation secondary to the corona epidemic .,4.333333333,3
I could have written that myself! However I was born with heart issues but since meno hit they've gotten way worse.,5,3
"As for the ear, 5 yrs ago I thought it was allergies, my left ear felt really full and everything sounded like I was underwater, then the buzzing, ringing, whirring started. Went to my doc he said he couldn't find anything wrong, sent me to the ENT, he did a hearing test and I had lost all my low tone hearing, he sent me for an MRI and no bone or other issues, so that was that, he wanted to see me in a year, he repeated the hearing test.",5,3
"I went from low tone loss to high tone loss and regained the low tone. He said hes never seen that happen before. The ringing has never stopped, I learned to ignore it.",3,2
"I can't hear much of anything out of my left ear. I just turned 52, but had a hysto 2001 and kept my ovaries. I've mentioned all these symptoms to my PCP, Cardiologist, Gynecologist and Oncologist and they all poo poo my symptoms and try to find other reasons,",5,3
"which so far they haven't and bc of no periods I have zero clue where I'm at in this process and none of them will check my hormone levels, they say they're not accurate, but I'd love to have at least something to go by.",3.333333333,2
"So, in my opinion it is your hormones and my best advise is try not to stress over it as hard as that is. I suffer from an anxiety and panic disorder and on medication for it but menopause sure knows how to kick into overdrive.. Good Luck!",5,3

"Its tough bc mine manifests into extreme nausea, hot flashes (these are worse than meno hot flashes) visible tremors, dizziness, ocular migraines, shortness of breath and chest pains.",5,3
"As I mentioned I already have heart problems so of course waking up with what I know is meno palpitations and will subside after I get moving it kicks the anxiety into overdrive, it's a viscous cycle. I take paxil and xanax but it's not a cure, it helps though.",5,3
"A few things that help naturally with anxiety is grounding yourself, use your senses, 5 things you can see, touch, and hear. Deep even breaths, in thru your nose out thru your mouth. Also, what a lot of ppl don't know is caffeine, chocolate and red meat is not good for anxiety, cut back on those if you eat them.",0,0
"I also find counting silly things helps. I was never good at meditation lol my brain is all over the place and never shuts up which is why I try to do activities.

I hope that some of these suggestions help and it eases your anxiety.. hang in there!",3.666666667,2

"I experience these. I have a long history of headaches and migraines, but my first ocular/headache with aura was around age 30. I had just finished playing racquetball and got the aura while driving home. I was scared that I was having a stroke, laid down when I got home & the headache came.",5,3
"I've since learned to take pain medication at the first onset of the aura (which usually lasts around 20-30 mins) & I can catch the headache from turning into a bad one/migraine. I can get them while looking at computer screen, reading a book in sunshine, or just about anytime, but often there's a light issue that will prompt it (likely the white walls of the racquet court).",5,3

"There are various causes of migraines: Eating foods high in nitrates, cheeses, chocolate, high sodium foods or snacks. Noxious fumes, perfumes, wearing hair ties or clips, muscle tension or jaw clenching, eye strain, changes in altitude and definitely hormones. I have read that a quick drop in hormone levels can bring on a migraine and this is what occurs when we menstruate. I do know that you have to take something for it as soon as you get a symptom of a migraine.  If not, it gets excruciating, nausia, sensitive to light and sound and movement.",0,0

Yes..   I get this headaches and it was around my period.   It seems like I get them for months then it stops for awhile.  When I did have them I would take sinus meds cuz I didn't know if it was a sinus headache or not.  They would last for about 2 days.,5,3

Hi. Im new to this discussion board.  I was told this morning that I need 2 iron transfusions.,5,3
Can anyone give me the good bad and ugly of what happens please?,0,0
"Sorry for my late response, I must have missed it.  I ended up getting a stomach infection after my iron infusion also. That's why it took so long for me to heal.",5,3
It was helicobacter pylori and it was hell. I was on antibiotics for 2 weeks to kill it off and finished them mid May. It took me up to early May to come back to work on reduced hours.  I am still feeling the effects of the stomach infection and not yet 100%.,5,3
"My specialist said that iron is such a strong mineral, it ended up washing away my whole stomach flora enabling the bad bacteria to thrive.",5,3
"Knowing what I know now, never again. I still have to manage my diet and avoid highly acidic foods, red meat being one of them but once my stomach inflammation heals I will increase my iron rich foods in my diet and have regular blood tests to monitor. I hope you are feeling better?",4,3
Thanks for the response. I’m still not better.,1.333333333,1
"No diarrhea anymore, but the nausea comes in terrible waves, exhaustion, fever. I can barely work a few hours a day. I’m on day 22 since infusion. How did they test for H. Pylori? Did you feel better once you started it?",5,3
When I was in hospital they did a colonoscopy and gastroscopy and found the bacteria in my biopsies. Everything else was all clear but the iron did make me very sick.,5,3
"Due to the bacteria I wasn't able to each much which meant my diarrhoea subsided but that's what put me in hospital initially, excessive diarrhoea due to the the iron infusion. My stomach feels better after having completed the AB to kill off the bacteria but I am still experiencing feelings of off balance/dizziness. I initially started feeling like this when I commenced on the AB for the bacteria and now it's just continued.",5,3
Seeing a second Dr on the weekend given my regular GP didn't have a clue.  I know it's not iron given my last blood test was over 6 weeks ago and iron levels high/good.  My specialist said it will take at least 6 months for my iron to settle.,5,3
When exactly did you have yours?  It may pay to see another Dr and get a second opinion.  Have you had the levels checked since your infusion?,0,0
"I don't feel exhausted like I used to when I was anaemic, my tiredness is different now and I feel it is due to my stomach infection and the slow recovery.",5,3
Wow. I can’t believe they gave you a colonoscopy in the hospital. I’m glad they found it.,0,0
I had my infusion May 21 and started feeling sick 2 days later.  Did you throw up as well?,5,3
How long did it take for the nausea to subside? Did the antibiotics help all the symptoms other than dizziness? You should definitely be taking a medical grade probiotic now to replace the knocked out flora.,0,0
"I’m resisting throwing up, but I’m so nauseous it’s hard to function. When I wake up in the morning, I almost can’t move I’m so sick. I wonder if H. Pylori could cause that severe nausea.",4.666666667,3
Did the doctors in the hospital think everything was from the infusion? What were their theories,0,0
"I had two with no problem. Maybe some stiff muscles and fatigue for a couple days. The third was fine during, but two days later it really messed me up, fever, muscle aches, anxiety, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. The nausea is still kicking my ass and it’s been 22 days. I won’t do it again. However, I don’t think this is the normal reaction.",5,3
"I had my infusion on May 26 and spent the next 3/4 days in bed with severe flu like symptoms, body aches and pains. Then the diarrhoea set in and I was in hospital on Easter Sunday, 1 April.",5,3
" Do you have severe stomach pain and nausea when you try to eat? if so, it may not be the iron but the same infection I got.",5,3
How is your diet? Can you eat?,0,0
I am part of Facebook group where another lady also got HP infection after an iron infusion so it does happen.  It can be detected via a stool test so may be an option for you if you still experiencing issues.,0,0
I still have bouts of nausea but I don't think it is from the iron infusion but from my spells of off balance/dizziness and I'm yet to find a Dr who can tell me what is causing it. My naturopath suspects it is still my inflamed stomach which takes a minimum of 6 weeks to heal.,5,3
"The antibiotics themselves caused dizziness/nausea (one of the many side effects listed in the leaflet) and only helped with everything but these symptoms. I did take a strong probiotic that my Naturopath recommended and I finished that last week, took it for a whole 30 days during and after my AB treatment.",5,3
"I didn't throw up but felt very close to doing so with the nausea and in the height of my stomach issues, wasn't able to eat a thing. It was only when my Dr placed me on Nexium to help with the stomach acid that it settled and I was able to eat very bland foods.  My diet has improved since I finished he AB though but I am still avoiding highly acidic foods until I can be certain my stomach inflammation is gone.",5,3
"The public hospital Dr's were clueless, I kept telling them I don't believe in coincidences and that the iron has somehow caused another problem with my stomach but they kept saying it was unrelated.",5,3
It wasn't until I asked for my own private Dr (I have private health cover) that he pieced it all together.,5,3
"He said, he suspected that given iron is a such a strong mineral and a lot of people experience gastro intestinal problems when taking any sort of iron supplement, that the infusion I was given was too much for me in one go, that it completely flushed out my gut flora and enabled the bad bacteria to thrive, hence causing my stomach infection.",5,3
"Agree it is not normal, I had all the symptoms you describe above directly after my iron infusion also.  We are the rare group who have severe reactions to the iron and unfortunately Dr's do not tell you this or monitor you afterwards to help you get back to normal.",5,3
It almost defeats the purpose of infusing you with iron when you are completely debilitated afterwards for an extended period of time.,1,0
aaah this is exactly what my doc said. You are one if the unlucky ones..,3,2
how does that helps us get back into our normal lives. I cannot stay in bed forever.,2.666666667,1
"I had my infusion on Friday at 12pm noon. I noticed yesterday afternoon and all of today I've had really bad kidney pain, I've checked and apparently iron is very harsh on the kidneys and 24hrs after an iron infusion you're kidney's excrete 5% of the iron given during it.",5,3
I also noticed yesterday my pee was rust coloured and very bad smelling for a while but that has cleared up now. I've got aching muscles too. I hope tomorrow I Wake up and these side effects are gone or going!.,4,3
I'm in Scotland in UK so had the infusion on NHS.,4.666666667,3

I will do Capsicum thanks.,4,3
"Can I ask you, how many days after the infusion do you begin to feel better?.",0,0
It takes about two or three weeks for the iron levels to rise so I’m not short of breath. But luckily I now have monthly blood tests and get the infusion done before I start feeling really bad.,5,3
Thanks. I think from now on I'll do the same and get regular monthly blood tests done.,3,2
"I also had two sessions over two weeks and thought wow not much in side effects as if there are side effects to be had I get them and I don't think my doctor always believes me. One week after the second infusion it started and I thought I had a tummy bug so isolated myself as I live in a retirement apartment and spend lots of time in the communal lounge and did not want to pass it on - it then seemed to clear up but a few days later it came back with stomach problems, nausea, headache and woozy, a very dry mouth and so very tired.",5,3
In some of the Forums later there is mention of H. Pylori which is of interest as I had to have treatment a few years ago for that so when I go to have the blood tests for the iron levels I think I will ask for that to be tested again.,5,3
"Can anyone out there give a clue as to how long all this will last, I only had the infusion as when the doctor phoned to say my iron was still low and to increase the iron tablets I was prescribed and I said I did not like being on them that she suggested the infusion so now do not know which way to go though having had the infusion it is too late to do anything until it wears off so how long will that be?",5,3
"I had an Iron Infusion over 5 weeks ago now and still feeling terrible. I have now seen an Endocronoligist who believes my symptoms are due to a significant drop in my phosphate level. A phosphate infusion did not help, think my Vitamin D needed to increased to allow absorrption. I am now on phosphate tablets , but still have a lot of trouble walking a lot of the time due to muscle fatigue and stiffness",5,3
I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced anything similar and if so how they recovered or what their experience was like. Thanks,2,1

I can be a burden to my peers and my family who feel they should look after me and you may feel that too but I can basically guarantee your child doesn't see you as a burden and wouldn't be better off without you.

State school is not your enemy though. I have taught in a lot of schools and you wouldn't believe how they can change from one side of the road to the other. Staff make a far bigger impact than children. I like to believe all children are inherently pleasant and want to achieve, the only thing that lets them down can be parents/environment, poorly organised schools and... yes stupid government policies!

However, again, I also recognise that it is also a large part of me that struggles to deal with things rather than letting it not effect me - basically what I'm saying is I personally feel my character is not really strong enough to deal with one of the most demanding professions in the world - especially in this country. Most of the public would laugh at that statement but they don't realise the daily abuse, work, stresses, observations, impossible targets etc - it is the most mentally challenging job out there and when you go home you still have work to do, none of this leaving it at the office, still got to plan and mark and assess.

They told me to take Zantac twice a day. They didn't go over diet with me or nothing just threw me pills! I have never had heartburn in my life, so it kind of threw me off that they wanted me to take antacid pills.",5,3
"When I started taking antacids....I started getting heartburn.... so I went to another doctor they did a CT scan, blood work, and took x-rays, and found nothing! So right now I am wondering why I'm taking allergy pills, and now I'm on Prilosec but I'm still having the sensations in my stomach and the feeling under my right rib and no one can help me:-(does anybody have any prognosis as to what the feeling under the right rib could be? Could it be the hiatal hernia off to the right side? One of my doctors says the hiatal hernia would be right directly under your diaphragm.... I feel like a hypochondriac and just want some answers...",5,3
"Hi everyone, I recently returned home from university due to the ongoing pandemic. When I’ve returned home slowly I have had spots and kind of rashes popping up randomly on my body. It’s in places such as my lower torso, groin, knee caps and a bit on my arms and calf’s.",4,3
"I’m not sure if this is contact dermatitis or something more serious like scabies or something.

Presently i am using ZeroDerm and find it does not have much of an odour.,5,3

"Hi there! I've just been diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and I'd really appreciate some help, because I'm very confused and not so sure about the diagnosis!! I'd love to hear from people that have SD and have had similar experiences.",5,3
"For a few months I've been having problems with my hair. It got very tangly/matted on top, and the underneath layer was disgustingly greasy and stringy, which would NOT wash out even with clarifying shampoos. My hair was also shedding massively and I had an itchy red rash on my face (treated with cortisone cream).",4,3
"I went to a trichologist who looked at my hair under a camera. He said that although my scalp isn't noticably flaky, it is inflamed and gooey under the camera so it's seborrheic dermatitis, and gave me a medicated shampoo. I also had low iron levels so I'm taking supplements.",5,3
After using the shampoo the tangles are better but the greasy stringyness is still there. This doesn't make sense to me - I know SD would give a greasy/flaky scalp but why would half way down my hair be stringy and not wash out?!? It looks disgusting and it's really upsetting me. Has anybody had a similar symptoms and how do you get rid of it??,4,3

"After washing with clarifying shampoos, gentle shampoos, the special mild medicated one I was given, it STILL won't come out and looks disgusting and I don't undestand it. Surely the shampoo is treating theSD, but that doesn't make sense to leave this stuff in my hair.",5,3
"I'm trying to treat it as gently as possible, with the mild medicated shampoo but it still won't get rid of the greasyness. I don't use cortisone cream on my face because of the risk of thinning skin, just a soothing emolient cream. It could have been low iron or stress that caused the SD, which I'm trying to combat too!",5,3

Hi! I literally have the exact problem and have been battling it for years  I'm only 19 and my hair is thinning really badly! Greasy hair is not fun and really frustrating  but the key to fight your seb derm is research. Only yesterday after months and months of research i have finally found a breakthrough.,4.333333333,3
"If you think about it, the main reason we have sem derm in the first place is due to the oil which breeds bacteria and yeast and causes flakiness and all sorts of other gross problems.",2.553333333,1
"So instead of trying to treat yourself with oil reducing products, shampoos, etc. that will only reduce it temporarily and not eliminate the root cause of the issue, we should be trying to determine what is the reason our body is producing so much oil so the condition will be eliminated.",2.553333333,1
The reason we have seborrheic dermatitis is due to overactive sebacious/ oil glands in the body (hence greasy scalp etc.). If you want to stop it for good you have to stop what is causing these overactive glands.,2.553333333,1
"A really realy common reason ive found for overly oily glands is when us women have too much testosterone/ androgens/ male hormones in our bodies. This  causes things like balding of the scalp, oily dandruff & greasy hair, excess/unwanted body hair in other areas which is something I suffer with, & oily skin and acne, etc.",4.333333333,3
So if you have one or more of these things it is honestly worth a check from your doctor to see if you have too much androgen in your body.,0,0
"In my case a lot of the symptoms described are what I have including a greasy flaky scalp & unwanted excess body hair, so it instantly clicked that this might just be it.",4,3
So im probably going to the doctor this week and getting it checked out. Ive heard that people usually have their issues such as seb derm cleared after they are put on anti-androgen treatment.,5,3
"I'm finally happy Ive found the cause and now I can be able to treat it properly! Ive battled with this for a while and its so hard and you feel crappy a lot of the time. Before it gets worse research/ or go to your doctor to see if you have too much androgens,etc. Goodluck",4,3

"The entire underneath layer of my hair (by my nape) looks like it's sopping wet and covered in grease just an hour or two after a shower nowadays, no matter what I wash it with. Is this similar to you?",4,3

"I did wonder about the too much adrogens problem too cause I heard that causes sebum problems, so I'm gonna try and get hormones tested (though I am on the pill so I thought that was controlled... maybe not).",5,3
How did it go with your doctor? any luck on finding a cause or solution so far? I'm praying I find one soon because I can't stand this greaair much longer,3.333333333,2
Please try to use extra virgin oilive oil on your hair after washing them. This should reduce the hair loss and retain moisture in your hair. Shampoo only once a fornight but feel free to wash them under water as and when you like.,0,0

I get this when I am very stressed. My hair starts to get almost waxy and won't wash out. I use baking soda and vinegar to get rid of it. Vinegar is the most important part. I recommend trying it out to see if it works for your hair.,2.666666667,1
"Searchinggirl, Did you ever find something that worked to get rid of the greasy, stringy locks? I have been dealing with the same thing on and off for five years, likely androgen sensitivity. I can't take anti-androgen medication (sensitivity) so have been taking saw palmetto, but when seasons change i really suffer for weeks at a time (hair loss, greasy sticky stringy locks).

"My best bet is to pre-treat with diluted zinc shampoo mixed with distilled water and wash with diluted baby shampoo (for suds) mixed with free.and clear shampoo.

"I was told that this could be due to scar tissue as I had undergone abdominal surgery when younger so I've now been referred for a CT scan to take a look at the last part of my colon.

Also since the procedure four days ago I've yet to have a bowel motion and was wondering if this is normal?",5,3
"Exact same with me, 4 years ago now. Nothing was found on the CT scan. Consultant reckoned I had a touch of irritable bowel syndrome and I had to find my triggers and amend my diet accordingly. I still get the odd attack depending on what I've been eating. Keep a food diary and see if there are any food types that could be causing your problem, good luck and let us know how your getting on.",5,3
Its funny you should mention diet as I've always been told by professionals to 'eat more fibre' which strangely enough has always made my constipation worse! Am I right in thinking then there is no specific treatment for a twisted colon other than a change of diet? ,3.666666667,2
I also suffer with a lot of right-sided stabbing pains and trapped wind and I'm hoping that I can be prescribed with something to help with this as some days its very debilitating.,4,3
"A dietician told me that a high fibre diet isn't suitable for everyone. As for trapped wind, yes a twisty bowel can cause gas pockets. Eating and chewing slowly and burping, helped to lessen excess wind passing into my bowel. I also found taking to charcoal tablets just before meals helped enormously.",4,3
"OMG how painful is this procedure??? I went to work while doing the bowel prep, wasnt advised not to and the hospital was suprised when they found out I had gone to work.",5,3
"The procedure itself was nothing short of horrific, I was screaming in pain and begging them to stop and I heard the Dr ask 'as she calmed down yet' this is not what I wanted to hear, he could of asked if I was ok.",4.666666667,3
"Anyway nothing was found except 3 internal haemorrhoids which were banded. The pain after was excruciating, I was sick and rolling around the bed in agony, not offered any pain relief. I kept saying how ill I felt and how much pain I was in and it fell on deaf ears. I was sent home with no painkillers or aftercare advice, I wasnt told what painkillers to take and advised to take a day off work due to the sedation and not the procedure.",5,3
"Every painkiller I took didnt get anywhere near the pain, warm baths are the only thing that helped a little. I couldnt make work for 3 days as I say I was on a scale of 10 for pain and here I am a week later still in pain. I have chronic leg pain, stomach pain and painful bum, my skin feels tender and bruised, I just dont feel right and have chronic diarrhoea and nausea. I have to go to work today and feel so ill and tired.",5,3
I am thinking of complaining about the procedure and aftercare but dont think it will solve anything.,3,2
"I had this very procedure done today and received lots of information beforehand. I knew that having to be close to a toilet meant stay at home as the prep was going to make bowel movements urgent. I agree that the procedure was painful, even though I had IV muscle relaxant and pethidine for pain relief.",5,3
"I can also remember what happened, although I wasn't expected to. The drugs are supposed to make the patient cooperative but relaxed and with no memory of the procedure.",5,3
I'm expecting further pain and discomfort from the banding procedures too but have been advised to take pain relief medication and also been told that I shouldn't go to work next week either.,5,3
I had banding done six weeks ago. It took about 3 minutes laying on my side. I felt nothing as they did it. A slight 'full' feeling for a couple of days and no problems and no blood since.,5,3

I too had a colonoscopy and banding couple of days back i too wonder the process was way too painful above all the sedatived didnt work on me i was in full consiousness the entire process. Colonoscopy was bearable compared to banding...i would advise people to opt for a good sedative it may ease the process. ,5,3

"Last night I went back to have the polyp removed and the hemorrhoids banded, under general anesthetic (I needed to be sleep for the polyp removal I think).

Hi I've just had colonoscopy yesterday and banding on 3 piles with no sedation and no gas and air. I've been in a lot of pain and only advised to take paracetamol. I had to go back to work today and I'm finding the pain hasn't eased.,5,3
"I had the same procedure done yesterday. good thing was it was all pretty quick, bad thing was it was very painful. I personally found the colonoscopy more uncomfortable as it lasted longer. It felt like my stomach was being blown up and I felt the strange sensation of air bubbles popping up in my tummy. It was really horrible and disconcerting but the team around me were very kind and reassuring. it was a real relief when this was over. then for the actual banding, perhaps the whole thing only took a minute or so, the scope going in was very painful and I screamed out a few times but certainly didn't want them to stop as I just wanted it to be over.",5,3
"I was given liquid morphine and some other pain killers, started to feel quite a bit better about half an hour later, but still with a lot of discomfort. last night slept quite badly due to discomfort but this morning things have improved a lot, still have a fullness/ache in the area.

I'm going to share my own horror story regarding my experience with haemorrhoid banding. I have had this procedure done three times now so far and saying it has been complete agony doesn't even come close to the pain. I've been iron anemic for about ten years now. As I've gotten older my health has deteriorated somewhat and the haemorrhoid bleeding has gotten more severe. About four years ago I was directed to a clinic that dealt with rectal problems.,5,3
It cost me $600 for the procedure involving a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and two days of prep which included laxatives and no eating. That alone was a nightmare. The day of the procedure the f**kwit doctor told me what I already knew (that I had bleeding haemorrhoids) and suggested I take Metamucil. Seriously! $600 and he did nothing! ,5,3
Fast forward a few more years as my iron levels are dropping and I have to see the same doctor with the hopes of having banding done this time. ,4.333333333,3
No way would I ever have this done again without a general anaesthetic. Most people are offered a sedative but when I had sedation it didn’t work at all. Luckily the doctor stopped when I asked her to. It was agony.,5,3
months later I was lucky enough to be sent to a private hospital on the NHS and the consultant agreed to a general anaesthetic.,5,3
"I didnt feel a thing, woke up with a little pain in my stomach but was given pain relief immediately. Spent a few hours in the hospital then allowed home.",5,3
i'd like to suggest every nurse/doctor who does this procedure should have to have it done first. they would soon make it compulsory to give G.A.,0,0
i had the banding done also. Not had any pain as such from that but 2 weeks after my procedure my haemorrhoids are still swollen so I don’t think the banding worked.,5,3

"We are told stay right by our bathroom, plan ahead, wipes, quick dropping sweat pants, cause you gotta ""go now."" We are given an IV, and put to sleep.

"There seems to be a growing trend of less or no sedation - certainly in the UK.  When I had no 1 eighteen years ago I was sedated and remembered very little apart from whimpering in pain.  When I had no 2 two years ago, all I got from the so called sedation was a badly bruised hand.  Then the endoscopist decided not to proceed and sent me for a CT scan instead.",5,3
Yes I found it ridiculous how alot of you people come out here and try to scare others who need to have this procedure done too me the worst part is the prep for it and the medicine they put in your IV may sting a little not everyone is alike on this type of test and if it was not for having this test what would we all do we all have to know if we have polys and or cancer this way til they come out with something new to replace this test.

I was told on my first op I would be off for a week then if I needed longer go to my gp to get a note. ",5,3
Its been over 24hrs since my operation and I was not allowed to drive or operate machines since I was put under. Plus I needed someone with me to observe me incase of side effects from the op.

"I have had issues with my right ear for the past month. For about 3-4 weeks I was experiencing hearing loss, ear pain, and little ear wax- with the ear wax I was having being runny and white. I was prescribed 2 courses of antibiotics.",5,3
"These past few days I have regained hearing in my ear but still experience occasional pain. I also have a lump behind my ear now. It is fairly large, hard, and sore and hot to the touch. I can also feel my heartbeat when I touch it.",4,3
"During the past month or so I have also had severe migraines. I have taken Tylenol, Motrin, and cambia powder for the pain. I have still experienced little relief. I also have Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. I am immunosuppressed and prone to infection. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas what this lump may be. I am concerned about infection or a constricted blood vessel considering these long term migraines.",5,3
on and off i get a clogged blcoked feeling in my ears. i can hear myself breath particularly through my left ear and its quitete annoying. it causes me to deel the need to clear my throat and nose often. no pain.,3.333333333,2
i went to a doctor two months aho and they told me it was ear wax cleaned it and nothing happened. along with thos i get the occaeional swollen glands in my neck and the need to swollow constantly to try clesr the swollen feeling.,5,3
i dont have a fever,0,0
my nose isnt runny at all,0,0
i dont have any ear pain,0,0
on occasion my neck will feel a little sore on my right side up under my jaw.,3.333333333,2
i also grt a bitter taste in my mouth.,2.666666667,1
my right tosil also seems a little swollen but ive only noticed this in the past day.,3.333333333,2
I know this is going to sound crazy but I went through the same symptoms but over time it got worse. I had my first ear infection at age fifty. I was on antibiotics and those the symptoms would go away but it didn't. Later on I had a routine colonoscopy and I was diagnosed with h pylori. I went through nine months of antibiotics before I was free of it and the ear problems. My point is keep trying to get doctors to check it out because it can be caused by things you wouldn't normally think would cause it. Good luck with it.,5,3
thankyou. im going to see my GP today so ill let you know what he comes back with.,4,3
"I've just had a stapedectomy in my right ear and thought I would share my experience with others who may be considering this operation. I'll try and update this every couple of days, but feel free to ask any questions you might have in the meantime. I've really benefitted from reading people's first hand accounts in the lead up to this op so this is my opportunity to try and give something back to this niche stapedectomy community ;-).",5,3
"Since Dec 2016 I started to notice that I was losing hearing in my right ear. At first it was only minor (20% loss) but by early 2018 I was classified as severly deaf in that ear at around 85-90% loss. The severe hearing loss had a big impact on my social life, my ability to carry out simple tasks (i.e. riding my bike) as well as my work (meetings became a struggle). All of this coincided with a 10 year relationship break up in 2017, which when combined with my hearing problems, made me the social equiavalent of Gollum from Lord of the Rings. Something had to be done...",5,3
"Getting the diagnosis for Otosclerosis in my right ear took a bit of time. Initially I thought it was wax build up and went to see a Dr in Romania while visiting my then girlfriends parents. They couldn't find any wax and recommended an MRI to check it wasn't anything sinister. Returning to the UK I got an appointment with the ENT department who undertook a series of checks and concluded I had Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Cue several months of steam baths, decongestants, anti-hystamines none of which were effective in improving my hearing. I also had a CT scan which confirmed that there were no tumours present (these tumours are often harmless even if found).",5,3
"My crude understanding of how they diagnosed my Otosclerosis is as follows. Ear drum was working fine, my auditory nerve was picking up sound fine (checked through bone conductivity tests if I remember correct) and my middle ear pressure was also good. By process of elimination they were pretty sure it was my a mechanical problem with my 3 ear bones, in particular the stapes.",5,3
"Just as dizzy as yesterday, cotton swab has a small amount of blood on it, ear pain definitely worse and can hear my heart beat/blood rushing sensation in my ear. None of this is unbearable and I still manage to talk to my sister on Facebook and listen to Adam Buxton's podcast. It's fairly embarrassing but one piece of advice I would give is get some 'stool softners' and or laxatives",4,3
A side effect of GA and pain medicine is constipation. Combine straining with a traumatised ear op and you have a fairly tricky pain balancing act while hovering over the toilet. Heed my words!,1.773333333,1
"Bad night of sleeping waking up in pain. Think I'm trying to do to much to soon. No change in hearing, but I'm really not expecting anything until the packing is out. Felling generally a bit deflated after the GA and not being able to do anything active...I am not an indoors person. Had a dizzy walked to the shops looking like a drunkard.",4,3
slightly better sleep. Still some pain but I've only taken one ibuprofen today so it could definitely be worse. Still some minor bleeding on cotton swab. Ear continuing to make weird farting and squelching noises. I'm pretty relaxed that my ear is in recovery mode so I'm not expecting any miracles at this point. You'll read on other forums that some other people are already back to work at this point,4.333333333,3
"This still feels some way off for me, but from what I've read about this procedure I can say for sure that everyone has very different recovery experience and associated timescales. Life can't be too bad as I've managed to write this post. Will update more over the coming days...",2,1
Thank you Jake.  Not my problem but most informative and sure to help others in your situation.  I will read Your updates with interest and I do hope this is a permanent fix for you.,0,0

"there's still some pain there but it's coming in sharp unexpected bursts rather than a dull ache. I've only taken a couple of ibuprofen so it's definitely manageable pain. Have to be a bit cautious with how I move my jaw, especially when eating or yawning as i feel like this sometimes sets back the healing. No change in hearing at the moment, but as stated previously I think this is due to packing. Getting lots of tinnitus and hearing my heartbeat, but none of this unbearable or wholly unexpected given the trauma to my ear!",4.333333333,3
Will probably cut these daily posts down to weekly as I'm running out of ways to tell you that I'm still a bit off balance and there's still a dull ache. Definitely all improving though. ,3,2
Feel good enough to take my guitar and sit by the river today and write a song about my ear. Ear canal is getting less painful and more itchy...annoying!,3.666666667,2
"Hi Jake - I had a similar procedure (laser stapedectomy) about 7 weeks ago. Still dealing with some balance and dizziness issues, as well as some ringing. Seems to be getting better but glacially slow! How are things working out for you at this point?",5,3
Nice to hear from a stapedectomy comrade in arms! Yeah so shortly after my last post I started to feel really good and everything was getting better. I then went to some works drinks in a really noisy pub and it completely knocked me out for a 4-5 days. Really bad tinnitus and the dizziness came back with a vengeance. It was really silly to be honest. Classic case of 'I feel physically better so everything must be completely healed.',4,3
"As for now (4 weeks post) I'm really happy. My hearing has definitely improved (although I would guess that most of these have been made in the bass/mid frequencies), my dizziness is still there in the mornings and when I'm really exhausted but generally is a whole lot better and my tinnitus has virtually gone. We'll see what the hearing test says though before I make any firm conclusions. Like you it's been a very slow and steady progression every day.  ",4.333333333,3
Did you have your hearing test yet? Are you getting water in your ear (showering etc.) at this stage? I stupidly booked a cycling holiday in France from July and then realised that I probably shouldn't take the Eurostar due to the pressure change. Ferry for me now....I hope the dizziness isn't too bad!,3,2
Glad things are improving for you. Would be good to hear how you are getting on. ,0,0
Thanks for reply Jake. Sounds like we're going through some similar issues. The first 4-5 days after the operation I couldn't walk without assistance which I wasn't expecting. I know everyone reacts differently to the surgery so I think mine hit me pretty hard relative to other stories I've heard.,5,3
"At this point I'm almost 8 weeks out, pretty functional but still haven't been able to do any exercise other than walking around which is driving me a bit nuts! Like you, I start feeling a bit normal and then overdo it and realize I'm not quite there yet. Still some dizzyness at times and light headedness when I'm moving around - although it is getting better. ",3,2
I actually have been taken some allergy medicine which I think has relieved some of the pressure from my ear - I had felt a constant need to want to pop my ear for the last little while. ,5,3
I did have a hearing test at 6 weeks - it looked good for the lower frequencies (for the higher frequencies it wasn't as good but the surgeon told me that will change so we'll see). It's hard for me to tell how much better overall it is at this point (I have a bit of ringing going on still) but I'm pretty sure there has been some improvement and I'm banking on a bit more as we go. ,5,3
Yes I was given the go ahead to shower normally at 6 weeks which was nice! Do you feel the pressure in your ear or are you worried about the Eurostar because of what the doctor has told you. I know that I wasn't supposed to fly for 6 weeks I think? I wonder how the boat will feel for you as far as balance etc. I have a boat trip as well in July and assumed I'd be all good to go but we'll see I guess! ,1.333333333,1
Nice to hear from someone with a similar experience. Good luck with everything and I'm sure you'll be good to go soon. ,0.333333333,0
Hey there.  How is the ear? I had my operation on 4th June. The first 10 days were horrible. I couldn’t leave the house without somebody being with me. I spent most of my time just lying around the house or out in the sun. I totally underestimated how bad the dizziness would be. I had very little pain but on occasions had a sharp stabbing pain. And the temple on that side of my head ached at times. I can’t believe it’s only been 4 weeks. ,5,3
" When I first got the packing out it was a nightmare with all the noises lol. My car sounded like a jumbo jet. I hated it. Everything was unbelievably Loud. Noise bald settled now and my hearing is so much better. It’s amazing. I’m finding my ear still a little achey at times deep down and my scar itches real bad sometimes. I went back to work 17 days after the operation, I work in care. I haven’t had any issues. I’ve been out walking and out on the bike too. Reading some other reviews has made me wonder if I’ve been overdoin it? ",4.666666667,3
Thanks for the music advice. I went to Ed Sheeran the night before my operation. I was scared while I waited on my app for the op and was overjoyed that it was the day after 🤣 only loud music I will experience anytime soon will be in the car.  ,3,2
Good luck with ure cycle. I’m sure if you if you are feeling good it will be okay.  I have my next appointment in August to have my hearing test done. my issue now is how itchy the inside of my ear can be at times.  I hope it is just the ear healing. I had my sister looking in armed with a torch 🙈 to see if she cld see anything in case something was wrong lol. Best of luck with ure next appointment,5,3
"I also had my op on 4 June and was off work 3 n a half weeks. The first couple of weeks were exhausting doing nothing and I never felt secure in myself doing anything. It's a strange op altogether. I feel my hearing has really improved, great not to wear a hearing aid. However I came on here looking for some answers... ",5,3
"My tongue is still slightly numb and I have a horrible taste at the side where ear was operated on. Has anyone else got this? Also, where the stitches, at the top of ear, is a bit numb!",5,3
Well hello stranger. How r ye? Lol my hearing is great. Workies have accused me of hearing the grass grow in comparison to how I was before. Having no hearing aid is amazing. I was actually thinking today when I was out walking how the left side of my tongue is still not 100%. The taste is slight and the numbness is like the last stage of being numbed at the dentist so defo improved. ,4.666666667,3
"I'm good thanks and like you loving the fact that after more than 10 years I've no hearing aid 😆 can't wait for December next year to get other one done. The taste thing is doing my head in, not appearing to shift. Hopefully I'll get up one morning and it'll be all good. Inside ear has been ok, no pain. ",5,3
I have at one point threatened to get the toilet brush to scratch the ear hahaha. It’s horrible. Worse when I wake up in the morning lol. I feel that my mouth is always very dry in the mornings now and althats when I notice he taste more too. I do remember Mrs McAndie saying to me hat the taste and numbness could last for several weeks before it eased off.  The morning of the op was the only time it was mentioned to me about getting the other ear done. ,5,3
My right ear is nowhere as bad as the left was. When is you’re next appointment? ,3,2
Many thanks for your response Andrea and I really wish everything works out fine in the end. I think our situation is very similar as I do have the balance issue/unsteadiness too. ,4,3
My doctor said that it might take a month to resolve and put me on steroids for a week. He said that this might be caused by hair cells in the ear not working properly at the moment..:( It would be great if you can share the results of your hearing test and I will also share feedback after my dr. appt in three weeks.,5,3

hello everyone its really good to hear your positive experiences with the surgery. i am also diagnosed with otosclerosis but since i am pregnant i cant have the surgery now.,5,3

unfortunately my tinnitus is just the same as before my operation and my hearing not much better than before i guess the plus side though is the disease isnt getting any worse im glad i did it but its not dramatically life changing for me,5,3
so how are you coping with tinnitus??,0,0
ive just tuned out of it and ignore it,0,0
"I had really bad tinnitus in the two to three weeks following the op but thankfully that has gone now, I didn't suffer from tinnitus prior to the op. However I still have not fully regained my balance and it's almost seven weeks now. And also the hearing is no worse but also not vastly improved. I do seem to be hearing odd sounds that I couldn't hear before eg. doors closing and other lower pitched sounds. I am awaiting a hear in g test but would like to see the surgeon again but doubt I will now. I saw him to have the packing removed but I guess from now on I will just see the audiologist.",5,3
"Hello everyone! Im so glad I found this forum since I had a stapedectomy last wednesday (Jan 9) and I totally underestimated the recovery process. The dizziness and lightheadedness are the two things that have really taken me. Ive been feeling sad and sometimes anxiety attacks because I feel something is wrong and I cant do the things I used to do before. Reading through your experiences and seeing you went through almost the same things is kind of a relief. My post op appointment is next Friday so Ill then know how the dr finds me. Id like to know how you are all doing after all these past months. Its reassuring and keeps me positive that everything will turn out alright. Just need some patience (which in my case, its not that easy🙄🤣)",5,3
"Hi 7 months now since I had the op. Hearing is brilliant and no major issues. Scar tissue gets itchy now and again. If anything I feel I can hear everything and can't shut off anymore by taking my hearing aid out. Due for next check at end of February and hoping I'll get the go ahead for other ear. You need to be patient, it takes time",5,3

"I'm so grateful for finding this post. It gave me a lot more insight before having my stapedectomy. I lost most of my hearing around age 31 but was dismissed for having caused it myself by spending time in loud environments (musician, gigs and clubs etc). It wasn't until I was 41 that further tests were done to diagnose otosclerosis, that was summer just gone.",5,3
"I had my stapedectomy on the 22nd of December, even though booked in as a day patient, they kept me in overnight. I couldn't keep any food down nor did I have any appetite. I pretty much slept for the following 2 days but gradually started to recover.",5,3
It's now been over a month since the op and I've not experienced any improvement in my hearing or tinnitus but I am still experiencing being off balance.,5,3
"At my check-up with the surgeon 3 weeks after the op, they informed me that my middle ear was inflamed so this is affecting my balance and preventing sound from entering my inner ear. I have been prescribed with some Ofloxacin ear drops (although pharmacist gave eye-drops which are okay to use, confirmed by audiologist). A hearing test this week confirmed that there had been no improvement.",5,3

Hi Michelle your situation sounds very much like mine...sad to say my op was in October and was also not successful. I now have no hearing in my ear and am still experiencing dizziness daily. I have written to my consultant expressing my concerns but still await a reply.,4.666666667,3
I know it was a gamble to have the op but having had my other ear operated on many years ago with great success I really thought this would work too. I hope that maybe you will see some improvement over time.,5,3
"I'm sorry about your experience, Andrea. What did they say at your last check-up? I am due to see my surgeon again in March. My audiologist told me that it should be rectified if it hasn't worked. From looking at reasons for failure from online searches, the prosthetic may not be correctly positioned.",5,3
The consultant said that he now thinks the otersclerosis had progressed to my inner ear and if that's the case then the op would not have repaired my hearing. I think they should have determined this before they operated! Also they never mentioned that a side effect would be in balance and I am finding this very difficult to cope with. Where are you based ?,5,3
"I'm sorry, I didn't get a notification of your reply. I am in London, UK. My surgery is being funded by the NHS.",5,3
"I had another appointment with my surgeon on Wednesday and he was quite concerned. He is going to ""go back in"" to see what's going on. He suggested that perhaps the prosthetic might be too long but will have to see. He may end up removing the prosthetic altogether.",5,3
"My surgeon has been performing the operation for 20 years and has only had 4 patients that it did not work for, those patients developed an infection, I think he said.",5,3

I have written to him to ask if the operation can be repeated (although, i was so ill following my op in October that I really do not relish repeating it!)",5,3
"He has told me that it is not possible to do the op again because of danger of facial paralysis and loss of taste ( which I already have down the left side of my tongue). After contacting him again to ask what he can do to stop the light headedness I am still experiencing he has made me a further appointment to go see him this Thursday. I will take someone with me this time to ensure I ask all the questions I have and see what the outcome is. Thanks for the link, I will try and read through this before my appointment.",5,3
I know what you mean about post op horror; I felt so regretful afterwards.,2,1

I was given a date for the operation this week. It's set for April 14th.,4.666666667,3
"I haven't been on the site in a while but was just reading through the thread as it sounds very similar to my experience. I had a laser stapedectomy done in April 2018 and while I have had some hearing improvements, I still have dizziness/light headedness on a regular basis, particularly when I move around.",5,3
I've always found it a tough symptom to describe but light headedness seems the closest which seems to be what you're experiencing as well. It's become tolerable but still affects my ability to be active etc. I saw the surgeon at least 5 times since and he had no answers for me which was really frustrating and he eventually referred my to another surgeon who I am seeing this May. I did have a CT scan done which according to him revealed nothing wrong with the surgery. ,5,3
When I see the new doctor I will be doing some hearing and dizziness tests which I've had up to this point but no good answers. We'll see if I can get any better answers and I will be sure to pass them on. Goof luck with your CT scan - Evan,5,3
I hope the new surgeon you see in may will will have some answers for you. It's all very frustrating and as you say it's so hard to explain how you feel....I can be knocked off balance at any time which is worrying especially as I look after my young grand daughters.,3,2
I will see if my CT scan reveals anything but I don't hold out much hope .,5,3
What did you find out from your CT scan?,0,0
I had my revision surgery on Saturday just gone and it was a very different experience. No nausea this time and I was discharged a few hours after surgery; they must have given me far too much anesthetic last time (I slept and barely ate for 3 days).,5,3
I still have the same issues with my balance but I hope this is temporary. I think I can hear a little. I had a small skin graft from my left forearm. I will have stitches taken out tomorrow and see my surgeon for a check-up next week.,4.333333333,3

"My report is also not great. My hearing is worse than before my stapedectomy and I still have vertigo. My surgeon doesn't know why I reacted so badly to the operation ie the excessive inflammation pushing the prostetic out of place. Although I had a small amount of hearing at my hearing test a couple of weeks ago, I think it's gone again. My surgeon doesn't know either what's causing my vertigo and suggested it may be some fluid leaking. ",5,3
"My doctor said he could inject me with some steroids to fix my balance but this would mean he would have to remove my hearing...but before we discussed my vertigo, which I don't think he was really acknowledging before, he he was talking about a prosthetic with a swivel in it. To be honest, I find him him difficult to understand and I have asked for a 2nd opinion/referral. I do not want my surgeon to do anything else to me. I have been told that I have to use my private medical insurance though (I have this through my work but I don't know how it works). I wish I had a copy of the waiver accepting the risks from having the stepedectomy. ",5,3
"I was prepared to maybe lose my hearing but not be left in this state. The person I have asked to be referred to specialises in stapedectomies, vertigo and tinnitus so I will trust whatever he has to say.",5,3
I would recommend people undergoing a stapedectomy to have someone who specialises in the procedure rather than someone who does it occasionally.,0,0
I cannot mask my tinnitus with my hearing aid on my operated ear because I cannot hear...what bad luck we have had.,5,3
Sorry that your operation didn't work. It is not a nice place to be in. I am also based in Yorkshire and had mine done 2 weeks ago. I was expecting a better result when they removed the packing however my ear just feels as though it is blocked and full of water. I occasionally thick it is going to clear but eventually it just returns to the same condition. I was wondering if you had the same problem and it didn't improve over time?,5,3
"To be honest I have lived for so long with poor hearing in this ear that you never really appreciate just how bad it is. I was expecting a minor miracle I think. Like you my ear felt blocked but I also had extreme pulsatile tinnitus which I had never experienced before, thankfully that went away after a few weeks. ",4,3
"I kept thinking that perhaps I would hear better but imagination I think as the hearing test showed otherwise! Keep up the hope though as many people say it takes time to improve, the ear I had done many years ago is just fine. I hope you see good results",5,3

Hello. They said to me last time that they wldnt be happy to the ither ear too soon. The hearing in the right ear had got considerably worse from Nov - April I said inwas happy with it at that time but i defo feel its alot worse now . My app isnt until May so will wait and see how much worse it is by then x,5,3
could I ask how the consultant knows the hearing loss in your other ear may be too near the inner ear?,0,0
I ask this because I had a stapedectomy last October which has failed leaving me my with no hearing in that ear and daily loss of balance. I have had to ask to see the consultant again as he just discharged me but I was not happy as you can understand. After much talking he has now agreed ( after the event) to arrange for me to have a CT scan as he thinks the otosclerosis had progressed to my inner ear and that's the reason the op failed. ...I cannot understand why this wasn't checked before he went ahead with the op.,5,3
"Hi, sorry to read about your total loss. The consultant referred to my hearing test and showed the hearing loss was quite near to inner ear which is why she wants to do another hearing test.",5,3
"Hi Everyone, i am now 7 months post op. Everything has gone smoothly, no complications until 2 nights ago i went to a musical where the music was really loud in the theatre. My ear started clicking and has continued to do so when i am in noisier environments. A police car went by this morning as i was walking down the road so i covered my ear and the sound was slightly distorted inside my head. Has anyone else experienced this? I have made an appointment with my surgeon on Monday but am slightly freaking out that the prosthetic thing has moved or something is wrong. HELP!",5,3
I am sure the prosthetic hasn't moved. As you may have read unfortunately my stapedectomy failed and since the op I also get clicking in my ear but as far as I know it's nothing to do with the inplant. I have a ct scan next week to try and ascertain the failure. Loud noises affect my ear as well although I now have no hearing in that ear. Will be interested to hear what the consultant says when you see him. Good luck but don't worry sounds like your op was a success....an op I had in my other year thirty years ago has given me no problem at all.,5,3
"Thanks Andrea, that is really reassuring. Not sure i could go through another op, i found the recovery horrible. Fingers crossed this settles down. Just trying to figure out why the loud music would have done this.. the prosthetic vibrated? I will report back to you all! x",5,3
I agree about the op....I wouldn't want to go through it again either. ...took two weeks yo recover and felt intense vertigo and sickness!,5,3

Thought i would update you after my last messages to you. So i saw the surgeon who was somewhat puzzled by my symptoms. Had a hearing test which showed a significant loss in that ear which baffled both him and I. To be honest i hadnt noticed! he said i could do nothing or have it done again. ,5,3
"To cut a long story short i opted to have it done again. He did the operation yesterday and he said when he went in he could see the prosthetic inside was bowing a little and not going into the hole its meant to in a totally smooth way. So he has replaced it with a thinner prosthetic and fingers crossed this time! just got to get through the next few weeks of recovery, again!!",5,3
BEST OF LUCK. I hope this time it works for you i was suposed to go for my yr check up but they have cancelled it again instead of may ive to wait till july,3,2
"Following my revision surgery a week ago (stapedectomy in December left me without hearing and constant vertigo), I received a letter advising that part of my bone had eroded due to inflammation and the piston was not in the right place. I'm worried that this vertigo is permanent now and wonder if they had checked earlier whether this could have been avoided. I'm due to see my surgeon in a week for a check-up.",5,3
I had a check-up with my otolaryngologist and he's certain that the vertigo won't be permanent. I've been prescribed some steroids for it but am waiting for my prescription to arrive.,5,3
He explained that I had had a bad reaction to the surgery and inflammation had pushed the prosthetic out of position. A lot of scar tissue had to be removed before using a vein graft to reposition the prosthetic. I have a little bit of hearing. I have hope again but I am not expecting too much just in case I am disappointed again.,5,3
"Good to read all this, had mine done 12 days ago. Was a day case, no issues and up and about the day after. Worked from home for a few days. Packing got taken out after 6 days by surgeon and can notice my hearing has increased slight already. As the days went on got even better, still don't think its at 100% but to me 100% better than it was. ",5,3
"Surgeon was fab, conducted around 150 of these and said only 2 have failed for him but explained why (mine conducted on NHS) Sometimes my ear feels blocked and like it needs to drain but nothing coming out, i know its still early days so assume i just need to let it heal. Some times voices and music sound lightly robotic, this comes and goes. Slightly disorienting but manageable not sure if this will pass or i just need to adjust? Don't know full change yet as have my first post op hearing test and check up end of August. I have tinnitus in this ear before the op, still have it currently at around the same level.",5,3
"this has been a great thread thanks so much for sharing your stories! i had my Spatedectomy (left ear) 3 days ago. so far taste is fine but still feeling a bit drowzy, off balance and have the throbbing in my ear ( it got worse after i slept on my right side a few nights ago). was wondering, has/did anyone else experience a weird 'jolting' of the room when yawning or burping? its as though everything spins a bit on a vertical axis everytime i do either or even when i stretch sometimes?",5,3
Hello its was a year past in june since my op . My dizziness was quite bad fir the first 9 or do days but it did settle. i also had some inner ear pain in occasions but it was like a stabbing pain and only lasted seconds but it also died down. I had my balance test a couple weeks ago and it all went well . ,4.333333333,3
If they asked me at the time of my last op to do the other ear id have ran a mile i hated the side effects but now i know it was worth it. Hope you have a good recovery and hope ure ear is as good as mine is now almost 100%,4.666666667,3
So glad everything has gone well for you and good luck with the second op.,0,0
"One year on, I have lost all hearing in the operated ear and still have unpleasant unbalance daily.",5,3
"I have been for a second opinion in the last few weeks but nothing can be done to restore the hearing, I could risk having the prosthetic removed to see if my balance will improve , but there is a chance that things could become worse. So I have decided to draw a line under it and just get on with living.",4.333333333,3

Hi everyone I had my operation yesterday morning. I Left the hospital and got into a taxi and headed home. MY ear started to bleed on the way home and was bleeding for approx 9 hours. I called the hospital and was told that was normal and just to put cotton wool into it. I have woken up on day 2 and yet again it has started to bleed but not as bad as day1. I have been reading through this forum and i have found it so helpful but have noticed no one has mentioned about getting a lot of bleeding so a little worried,5,3
Aw Jason thats awful.I never had anything like that at all. All id say id if ure concerned just keep calling them.,0,0

"I had my stapedectomy four weeks ago. The op seemed to go fine and the surgeon was happy enough. I certainly couldn't hear anything all through the 2 weeks that I had the packing in. When he took it out, he also said that he wouldn't have expected me to hear anything with the packing (it would have been good if he'd told me at the start). Since the packing came out, my hearing seemed to improve gradually for a week or so. ",5,3
"I found if I put music on my phone near my ear, I could hear it, but it was very distorted, like an old transistor radio, and slightly after I hear it in my good ear--which is very weird. Then about 5 or 6 days ago, it went right back to the start and I could hear hardly anything. Very gradually, it's starting getting better again, but I have to have it quite loud to hear the music, and it's still a fraction of a second late and the pitch isn't right.",3.333333333,2
"When people speak (or I speak), it's quite loud but distorted so I can't make out the words, plus it's like someone playing the kazoo loudly inside my ear (or the Clangers). This makes it difficult to concentrate on what people are saying.",3.333333333,2
"I also notice that if I brush my ear with my fingers, I can hear a noise right by the ear hole (which is loud as I would expect), but there's no noise if I brush the lobe or the outside of the ear.",3.333333333,2

So the other day I blew my nose and soon after I had pressure and pain in right ear like fluid or something else was clogged in there. I've been congested the past few days but I don't think this is connected anymore. It's now not painful but just pressurized feeling and uncomfortable with ringing. I can still hear out of it but not well.,4,3
"The other side of my head altogether is fine. It's been almost a couple days now and I don't know what do as nothing has helped. Breathing exercises and chewing has done nothing and when I strongly breath out I can hear the air going in with more muddy amplification than the other. If I make a vocal sound while doing this I hear it very loud from the inside. If I blow it and get something it's always a crackly, squelchy sound. No discharge or anything on the outside. I'm not having any nausea or vertigo/dizzy spells. Just full, uncomfortable, and ringing.",4,3
HI Chris. it sound you might have fluid behind your ear drum or blocked Eustachian tubes. ive had ear problems since i was small and i know how you feel. its horrible have bad ears. Get an appointment with your GP as soon as possible. Ears are complicated things. I you feel better today.,4.333333333,3
Yeah I did some exercise today where I sucked in hard and it got somewhat better when I felt some stuff dislodge in there. I'm gonna see what happens after my sinuses finally get fully over their thing right now because that's possibly what blocking it and in some freak accident I somehow while it was mostly blocked still got something up there which should be soon seeing as I'm not even having any more mucus and take it from there. I can definitely tell it's most likely fluid cause I can hear things up close but I can't hear anything fully and there's a bit of pressure but it's not painful. ,4,3
 Doing some research here for this situation it seems like people usually just get some antibiotics thrown at them and the rest is a waiting game while taking care of it.,0.333333333,0
"I've never had this happen to me before, I listen to a lot of music and love nature too so this is extremely irritating. I guess I'll just pretend for now that I went to the loudest concert in the world and it's taking too long for my hearing to bounce back in the mean time. Praying for miracles, I can't believe something like this happened during a time where I was already stressed out.",4,3
i have eustachian tube dysfunction with chronic ear infections have tubes in both ears and baha implant which stays infected Have been using manufactured ear plugs to keep water out but Doctor suggested cotton and vaseline its very messy any suggestions on keeping ears dry with other plugs or general info to help me been going on for years,5,3
"So it all started in late December/early January. My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought.",4,3
The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird.,4,3
"I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back.",4,3
I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue?,4,3
I used it for one week straight. Didnt work.,0.333333333,0
Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February.,4,3
I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack.,5,3
"The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it.",5,3
She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February).,5,3
Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a virus that stuck around since January.,5,3
"He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen.",5,3
Now its been a few weeks since my appointment.,3,2
"My head still feels swollen but not as much during the day as before. Also, my facial tension has slightly diminished. Not as much vertigo. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling.",4,3
"That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms. It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day.",4,3
Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it.,4,3
"The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure. Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles.",4,3
"Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder.",3,2
I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day. Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure.,5,3
Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms.,3,2
Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety?,0,0
"I have had the same, cold which came and went not too severe but left me with a lot of mucous. Felt as if sinuses blocked. No vertigo this time but eventually left with blocked ear. Doctor prescribed Otomize spray (I am in the UK) for a raging ear infection. After 7 days it is a lot better and although not perfect blocked feeling and crackling noise have greatly reduced. The rest of your symptoms sound like anxiety which I also have. I would go back to your physician and don't panic! I'm sure it will clear.",5,3
"thanks for your reply. The thing is I had flu-like symptoms in January. However, I didnt have mucous once i started developing these vertigo symptoms. Nor did I have a fever. Ive had this supposed ear infection for over a month now. Is that normal?",5,3
I don't think so - go back to your doctor. Maybe try a different antibiotic.,0,0
"I have most of your symptoms, tinnitus for 3 months now and it's very nerve cracking. My tinnitus started after a really bad migraine then, pins and needles all over my body, heavy breathing but for 10-15 min then I would calm down. That is anxiety and I found that camomile tea helps me a lot. I went to the ENT for this tinnitus, no ear wax, no infection, no hearing loss so nothing physical visible, for this reason he sent me to have an MRI and it's due on the 24th of March so hopefully nothing serious. I would go back to the doctor and ask for a referral to the specialist to get an answer.",5,3
"I never though I might have Tinnitus. Thats quite peculiar. can I ask, do you have the swollen head feeling? Also feel like you have low blood sugar?I dont have much vertigo anymore but if Im standing up, I get winded very easily and it makes me feel like throwing up. Especially if I try carrying something.Does that happen to you?",4,3
"I never had vertigo, dizziness or loss of balance. The only thing is that my sinuses are blocked kind off, had antibiotics on the week of 10th of feb and I thought that my tinnitus will go away, it's mild ar the moment as I started to take sinus sudafed (1 every 6 hr) no more then 4 in 24hr and i feel much better. ",5,3
" If I were you I would go to the doctor and ask for a full blood count, as these symptoms like throwing up and vertigo, that might be lack of iron, vitamin D there are lots of factors actually. I am not a doctor so my advice is to go and check your vitamins with the full blood count, and regarding your ear go to an ENT doctor, he can find out what's going on.",0,0
Are you in the UK? is it difficult to get to the doctor where you are?,0,0

Can an ear infection all of a sudden make me deficient in all these types of areas?,3,2

Just go to a walking centre and see what they advice you to do next.",5,3
"I have it done on the 24th of March and they said that it take 2-3 weeks for the results to come through and it will be sent to the GP or the ENT doctor. I am waiting.I asked the nurse who procced the MRI if he can see something wrong and he said if that would be the case he will sent me to the emergency straight away, but he said to wait for the results.",5,3

"i have been googling my symptoms at least once a day, and although im not anxious now (frustrated, if anything), i wonder if my body subconsciously reads that and is causing me these constant physical symptoms?",4,3
"yes, it's good that it wasn't and emergency. I hope the results will come ok. My tinnitus is still there and now I have crackling sound now and then in my ear for no reason. No head pressure but cold hand and feets I had it all my life, that is bad circulation or lack of iron in my case, but as you describe it might be anxiety?",4,3

"i dont have those anymore, although I do have moments where im heartbeat rises super fast when i get up or start moving. More so than usual. Also, I do have higher blood pressure lately. But im not sure if thats due to my symptoms or potential illness or because of cholesterol etc.",5,3

Has anybody any answers.,0,0
I have had this for a long time. Recently started using a nasal wash using a Neilmed sinus rinse bottle and sachets supplied with it (from Boots). Doesn't sound very nice but is actually quite easy (removing tube from inside bottle makes it easier).,5,3
"Just lean over sink, put head on one side, apply opening in end of applicator to upper nostril and squeeze, keeping mouth open. Rinse runs out of lower nostril. Repeat in other nostril. Surprisingly comforting if you use boiled water at body temperature.",0.666666667,0
Have been using a few weeks now and am MUCH better. Will keep it up once a day.,0.666666667,0
I will certain pop to Boots next week and purchase the Neilmed sinus rinse.    Does it ease the cough at all?,4,3
"I spoke to another doctor on the panel at the surgery , mine was on holiday thank goodness, and she had prescribed some anti-histamine tablets to start with and then if they are no good (which they appear to be just that – no use or ornament ) then she will prescribe some other tablets.",5,3

So a trip to Boots it is.,1,0
I also have a cough and a lot of throat clearing. My doctor says it is gastric reflux irratating the larynx (even though I don't get heartburn or indigestion).,5,3
I'm on Lansoprazole and Gaviscon (don't take together) and have improved although not completely better. It can take several months of treatment apparently.,5,3

HAPPY CHRISTMAS AND AN EVEN BETTER NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL.,0,0
Hi and Happy New Year to you All,0,0
I duly went to the ENT department and saw a very lovely Consultant. He tried to look down my throat but realising that I am absolutely useless and gagg all of the time when this happens he then put a camera up my nose and had a good look round.,4.333333333,3
"He told me that he could see nothing wrong, voice box was perfect , back of throat perfect, could see slight acid damage from reflux though but nothing serious.",1.66,1
I came away with the NeilMed Sinus Rince information and have ordered a kit from the pharmacy and will pick this up today.,3,2
Bless him he said just to get the bottle and make your own nasal douching recipe yourself.,1.66,1
This is 1/2 tsp of sea salt (not table salt) 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and 240 mls of sterilized water.,0,0
"I am in the UK and I gather these Kits are about £12 - £13 , so not cheap. If you had a rinse bottle you could make your own up.",0,0
He also recommended that I take a good tablespoon of Gavison an hour before going to sleep at night.,3,2
I will let you if there is any news of any improvement.,0.333333333,0
"During the first year of this illness I couldn't even imagine having a normal life again. The symptoms were just so scary and never ending (from the typical fatigue, sore throat and dizziness to sensory hypersensitivity, painful scalp, dry mouth, hives, rash and awful anxiety) and I felt the life I led before the virus had all but disappeared",5,3
"For these reasons I also spiralled into depression which of course didn’t help anything. But there is hope! I'm pretty much back to 100% again now, working 36 hours a week, socialising like before and I even went on two overseas trips last year. The awful lingering symptoms of anxiety and dizziness have now FINALLY gone and I'm getting on with living my life again.",5,3
"An important lesson I have learned for the best recovery is this: do not expect recovery to be a sprint race – it is a marathon for sure. You can’t fast track recovery by trying to push through and rush back to what you were doing before. It’s a grinding zig zag process of feeling like you’re recovering and then feeling like you’re right back at square one again, over and over.",3.333333333,2
"This is the normal recovery trajectory for this virus. Please continue to listen to your body and if you are tired, experiencing symptoms, not coping, then it’s probably your body telling you that you need more rest and care. I ended up taking 10 months off work in total. ",5,3
"This virus isn’t anything to take lightly either. It’s been linked to more serious conditions which makes it all that much more important to take care of yourself now. Wishing you all lots of rest and support, and as quick a recovery as possible.",0,0
"glad to hear you feel good. Im close to 4 years now and even though I improved a lot I still cant lead a normsl life. I attend university and thats alright but apart from that cant really do much more. However, for past few months I have finally stabilized and moving forward without any big crashes. I wish I knew what to do so much sooner. 4 years of missed life is a long time",2,1
I'm happy to hear you've improved a lot Lob and I hope you continue to improve up until you're eventually 100% again. It's really promising to hear that you're not having any flare ups. Hopefully 2020 is the year you regain your health and life again.,0,0
i feel like there is no point after this though. As if everything lost meaning. Even after I recover completely this is gonna take maybe even longer to resolve.,3.333333333,2
"I'm sorry you are feeling that way but I can completely understand why you do. After being forced to live in a way that you haven't chosen due to illness, having to give up stuff you like doing, etc, having the virus rob you of 4 years, it's understandable that you might feel depressed and disillusioned at what life is like now. Living with this virus does whole heartedly suck, for sure!",0,0
"Please continue to have hope that things will get better though. It's a really promising sign that you've noticed an improvement in your symptoms, which hopefully means your body has turned a corner.",0,0
"For me, even after living with the virus for 2 years it had lasting psychological impacts like having terrible anxiety every time I'd feel tired after having a big day, and even developing a bit of health anxiety around cuts getting infected etc. I continue to work through these issues. This might take a bit longer to resolve for you too, but you can get through this",5,3
i've worked with people who have had ME/CFS and they have also recovered completely over time. Please continue to have hope that things will return to being good for you again.,0,0
can you explain more about the people with cfs that recovered? i have been struggling for a long time like lob. i was told i have cfs. how long did it take for those people to recover?,5,3
"Hi Brent, thank you for your message. I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve been struggling for a long time. A lady I worked with was diagnosed with Ross river fever in 2011 which then led to her developing CFS in 2012. I’m not sure how long it took her to recover but I know that she is back at work now (at a different workplace to mine), travelling regularly, attending festivals and raising her 14 year old son",0,0
"glad to hear you're doing much better. you and I share a similar timeline, I had my first big symptoms in August 2017. I got over the worst symptoms after about 4 months but had a couple relapse type occasions over the next year and a half. Now, I've been 95 percent or so for the last 6 months or so, working, traveling, climbing.",3.333333333,2
"the other day my mom got some news that she has some health concerns, and the stress of supporting her through it seems to have given me a minor flare up of symptoms, nothing to make me have to miss work or anything, but I can see that I still can be effected by stress more easily than before. ",3.333333333,2
"Meditation has been one of the biggest contributors to my recovery, as I believe our bodies need help settling down after the trauma of these viruses. I hope all can remain hopeful and make the best lifestyle choices they can each day to support their recoveries.",5,3
"Hi Nick, I'm sorry to hear about your mom, I hope she's ok. Great news that you've been able to regain lots of your pre-virus activities again. Yes, I also notice that i'm more susceptible to stress but like you, my most recent flare ups don't require me to take time off work, I just need to rest a bit more on my weekends etc.",3.333333333,2
I hope you continue your run of good health and that your flare ups eventually disappear forever.,0,0
"Thank you for the reassurance KS2017, and I'm glad you're doing well! Would you say that after about one year you started to feel better and could gradually do more activities? And did the relapses that you had became less intense?",0,0
 I hope that you are also making a good recovery from this awful virus. I did start to feel gradually better after 12 months but I would say that my main health breakthrough came more after 1.5 - 2 years. Everyone is different though so your recovery may happen a lot sooner than mine did.,3.666666667,2
"After the first year my relapses would still floor me and would last around 3 weeks, but after 1.5 years they would only last 1-2 weeks and were less intense. My most recent relapse was over Christmas (at 2.25 years) however this was because I’d just done an intense 3 week oversea trip to Asia, and I still didn’t have to take any work off due to the relapse, I just had to rest a bit more over the weekends.",3,2
 Please try to be patient as you too will recover from this. Make sure you continue to listen to your body as much as you can and take care of yourself in the best way you can.,0,0
"I'm almost 10 months in now after contracting EBV on a backpacking trip in Asia. The first couple of months I tried to ignore the fact that I was sick, which I still regret... Luckily, I live in an European country where sickness leave from work is not a big problem, and I have the possibility postpone some courses of my Master's degree. ",5,3
"I feel that for the ones who are sick for a long time (say 6+ months or so), there is definitely a psychological component. So much anxiety does get in the way of healing, I think. I'm slowly accepting that I am sick, but I still have hope that it will get better. Messages like yours really help in keeping my/our hopes up, so thank you!",4.333333333,3
"I could have written this myself, every single thing...when all this started 2 years ago I seriously thought that these symptoms would never go away, months just went by and I started forgetting what my normal felt like. Im so happy you are better and feeling like your old self! So am I, I feel much better, stronger and Im enjoying life again as much as I can.",4,3
"b12 shots helped me a lot and my young daughter that kept me going...However at exactly 2 years of this, Im still having some neurological symptoms that worry me, muscle twitching (its way less but comes and goes) but its the internal vibrating, like my insides are shaking that really concerns me,its there every day since this started, especially when I wake up in the mornings...just wondering if you had that and if it went away??",5,3
" I am so glad to hear that you’ve started feeling better and stronger. It’s such a terrible virus and you can’t really know what it’s like to go through unless you’ve gone through it yourself. I continued to have symptoms past the 2 year mark too, and feared that maybe these would just remain with me (for me it was the anxiety, dizziness and pins and needles), but over the past 3-4 months these symptoms have also disappeared. ",5,3
I do remember feeling an internal rocking sensation and being startled awake during the virus but I don’t experience these symptoms anymore. I wonder whether it’s just a slow process of the body regaining its equilibrium over time?,5,3
"Thank you so much for the reply, not even doctors understand what we go through and just put everything down to anxiety.. I hope that its just a matter of time for this nasty symptom to go away, it seems that every month in this virus counts and slowly things improve...good luck thanks for giving us hope!",5,3
You are so right on doctors not really understanding this and so many times I was told it's anxiety. My doctor now is more understanding and helpful but it was rough with the past one who just wanted to put me on anxiety meds and would just look at me like I'm crazy everytime I mentioned my symptoms.,5,3
"one of the longer running symptoms I experienced is similar to what you describe as internal vibrating. I would often have a sensation of what i called an inner pulsing, like i could feel my blood pulsing through my body in a more acute way.",4,3
"sometimes i’d feel it in my throat, sometimes in a limb or in my fingers, sometimes in my middle. im still not sure what it meant exactly, but i think it was related partially to my nervous system being kind of amped up and feeling things more acutely. This was one of the last symptoms to dwindle down, and it only happens now if ive been living heathily, and if it does come, its like a whisper compared to how it felt before.",4,3
Ive seen several others have these kind of feelings so i dont think its extraordinarily,0.333333333,0
"I've been in the same position many times. I saw 4 neurologists when all this started because of my neurological symptoms, I seriously thought I had ms etc.. ALL of them just prescribed anxiety meds or antidepressants... one also told me ""mid-life crisis"" ....I always felt worse leaving the doctors office.",5,3
"I thought I was having a seizure the first time it happened, that's how strong it was, a full body internal tremor... I know what you mean by saying that it feels like a whisper compared to what it felt like and I'm glad its almost gone for you..as the months go by its like its volume has turned down but its always there when I wake up in the morning, daily since Feb 2018.... thinking positive that this too shall pass..",4.666666667,3
"I'm so happy to hear that you've made a full recovery from this awful virus Clidecjay, it is hard not to fear the worst when your body is doing all these strange things due to the virus. Hopefully we can help bring hope to those still going through this awful illness, and give them faith that they too will recover fully over time.",1.66,1
"I’m sorry to hear that you’re still struggling, but please keep having hope that you will heal from this in your own time. I know what a terrible struggle it is to wake up every morning feeling like it’s just going to be like this forever, but you will get better. ",1.553333333,1
"Keep listening to your body and resting. If you can’t handle going out at night yet then that’s ok, don’t go out at night. I don’t think I”ve actually really been out at night much since being sick, but that’s mainly because I’m old and boring…haha. Wishing you many better days to come.",4.333333333,3
yes im doing ok thank you ! can manage ok if i dont push it ...get stressed sleep well etc . its just been a long hard journey 😦,3,2
Good to know u have recovered. can u advice on the supplements that helped your journey.,0.333333333,0
I saw a naturopath regularly while I was sick and was on supplements a lots of that time. The main ones that I think helped me were zinc and Vitamin C and immune boosting mushroom powder. I was taking high doses of both of these under the direction of my naturopath. I was also taking vitamin D and iron tablets as I found the virus really depleted these vitamins in my system as indicated by blood tests.,5,3
Once I started recovering again and started being more active (i.e. not just lying in bed all day) I started taking a plant based protein powder and eating more protein like chicken and eggs as my muscles had all but wasted away and I needed to rebuild. I found this really helped with my energy levels too. Wishing you a speedy recovery.,4.333333333,3
I am glad you are getting back to normal. It's also good to hear your experience. The painful scalp and dry mouth that comes and goes has been baffling and sometimes I wondered if it was even the virus or just me. You are so right on how this pushes you to the point of depression. ,5,3
"I try to be strong but sometimes I think, ""If this is what the rest of my life is going to be like then do I want to live like this?"" It's such an ugly virus and the information surrounding it and given to us isn't all clear and accurate. I know I'll get past it though, God is with us and he will see us through no matter what. Thank you for sharing your story and I'm glad you are healing well and moving past this now. I look forward to being there, even if it does take another year or two.",5,3
" It’s really an awful virus and journey to have to go through, and the chronic and long nature of it is just so trying. I kept reminding myself too that God was watching over me and helping me to heal, and also maybe helping me to develop some patience and faith. ",5,3
 I also found that doctors just had no idea what the virus actually entailed and I gained a lot of hope from this very forum. Keep listening to your body and resting as I really believe these are the two most important things you can do to aid your recovery. I remember reading recovery stories when I was in the thick of the virus and I longed to be there. You too will recover and you will one day share your own recovery story as well.,5,3
i went to the dentist yesterday after 2-3 years i need 3 fillings hygenist said dry mouth can cause this .,5,3
i actually meant that message for you . Theyve given me xylitol to try for the dry mouth ... i never knew that could cause decay ? but it does 😦,5,3

"Its been a while since I’ve posted, i am in my 7th month of gf and while a lot of my symptoms are gone! I have a couple lingering ones, one that has really been bothering me is I’ve had face numbness and my head as well!! It’s scares me to death and I’m looking for anyone else that may or is experiencing this with mono!! Oh and just my left eye pain comes and goes and sometimes my eye will itch, it’s soo bizarre!’",5,3
I've had this symptom too! I'm at the beginning on my 6th month and have had a numb or tingling left foot and in the past couple of weeks I've had tingling in my cheeks and hands. It freaked me out too because I get this sometimes before I faint so I thought maybe I wasn't getting enough oxygen but I think the tingling is just another symptom of mono. ,5,3
"Has yours been more tingling and mainly in your foot/feet!! Mine has been all on my head and fave and that’s when I get this awful eye pain, but only in my left eye!! ",3.666666667,2
"I had my eyes checked when all this started and all was normal!’ I hate it and this virus!’ And do you have itching as well?? I had the itching in the beginning on my neck when I had the awful neck pain, which I still have but has improved tremoundsley!’ Seems to come when I’m tired or stressed!",5,3
"I've had the tingling and numbness mainly in my left foot and only occasionally in my face. I've had some itching in my feet but not my neck. I find the tingling gets worse when I'm feeling most run down and when my other symptoms (tired, dizzy etc) are also bad.",4,3
If you're worried then the doctor can give you a blood test to see if anything else is going on. My dr said that tingling and numbness can be a sign of autoimmune reaction which you can get a blood test for but she said it's unlikely and that it's probably just me,4.666666667,3
"That's good to hear that a lot of the symptoms are gone, I just want to reassure and encourage that ALL the symptoms eventually do go, including the face numbness and not feeling right in your head.",1.66,1

"I was diagnosed with glandular fever yesterday and apart from the ""regular"" GF symptoms I have also had pain, itching, tingling and numbness on the left side of my face for the past 4 months.",5,3
when the pain around my eye gets especially bad my vision becomes somewhat blurry on that eye (but always goes back to normal again). I also have a radiating pain from a lymph node behind my left jaw / under the ear when the numbness and tingling happens. ,4,3
 My theory is that this lymph node presses on the facial nerve so it becomes inflamed and causes those sensations in the face. But it is just a guess. Has it gotten any better since you wrote your post? ,1.66,1
"Yes it has gotten better, still there but I went to an internal medicine Dr about this and she tested my B12 level as she said it can cause the numbness, and sure enough it came back that my B12 was extremely low. ",5,3
 I am taking B12 supplements now and go back in June to get re-tested on B12. So we shall see if my level rises and if I am still having the  numbness then it has to be related to the Mono.  Crazy dang Virus isn't it???  ,5,3

ive had all those and more. finally feeling human again after 3 years and strict diet change along with supplements. you will get there. but you need to basically make your body environment uninhabitable for the virus so it goes dormant. it robes you of b12 so pain and nerve issues can crop up. try methylated b12 and magnesium glycinate. its been a crazy ride.,2.666666667,1

"Our stories are literally the same! I am 19 as well and have convinced myself that I have cancer too! Deep down inside, I know that these symptoms are definitely from mono, even though they are on and off. I have been sick for almost two months now and I have definitely let the anxiety take over and I have completely lost hope of getting better! I hope you are beginning to feel better as well, and we can both get through this!",5,3
"Distraction is good too so if you can do anything, even small things that don't take much energy or stress, to take your mind off it for a while that can help - for me it was just basic things like watching tv, going for short walk each day when able to, talking with family and friends, still seeing friends or if not able to talking with them on the phone or having them visit.",1,0
"I know it all sounds basic stuff but it really can help - and of course just don't overdo it get plenty of rest before or after doing anything. Hoping for a better weekend, and remember there is hope - God knows how hard things have been Madison and He will get you through this and heal you, I really believe that.",0,0
 iI never thought id feel whole again. it takes so long you think this is your new life. aside from some minor thyroid issues that are resolving hopefully. I am doing so much better.,4.333333333,3
I am back to working full-time. I go to the gym. And I could finally be the mom that I want to be to my kids with energy and joy. You are such an inspiration to making me feel like I was going to be a human being again.,0.666666667,0
Thank you for your love for everybody and your understanding. And yes you will heal from this beast but it just takes time. But keep the faith and tell yourself that you are getting better every day and you will. Time will pass and it'll feel like eternity but you will get better!,1.66,1
"So glad to hear you are doing much better, this is great news. And really thanks so much for the kind words I really appreciate them, still struggling myself at times and I need to do better with holding onto hope and belief that will get through my own issues at the moment, certain things have just seemed to hard to get over with my back, health and losing job and just hoping it's not always going to be this way and there can be a good purpose and peace, health and better times ahead!",2.666666667,1
"Your words give me hope Rolane and I'm grateful for that. And remember you've shown so much courage and determination to get through this illness yourself. so take great heart from that and wishing you and your loved ones all the peace, good health and happiness this Christmas!! Take care and do keep in touch!",0.333333333,0
I would like to share my symptoms… i got ebv almost 6 months back… still suffering…,4.666666667,3
"major symptoms i faced are body pain and that too sharp pain all over the body. mainly shoulder, back of the body &collar bone area. also sharp pain over throat area (not sore throat. i never had it). then tongue sores - this really scared me. it comes and goes. initially tongue got whitish. later it got better, but followed by mouth sores. also couple of times tongue was swollen. ",4,3
still i am suffering. either of these issues keeps on coming and disappearing. initially i did all the test and all results were perfect. i googled and learned about this virus and then i went for ebv & Cytomegalovirus test and got +ive for ebv.,5,3
"i learned that it manifest differently on different individuals. to be honest i was and am really scared.. but now after reading your stories, i am now optimistic that i will be ok one day...",1.333333333,1
I would like to point out the other main issue i faced. Which was to convince the Doctor what i was going through. they were not believing what i was saying and they thought i was just exaggerating. since everything was normal in my blood test...,5,3
"Had a couple of blood tests that came back clean. Doctor was clearly disinterested in my situation after that. Over a month later, my spleen and stomach were both terribly swollen and I was constantly sweaty. I returned to the doctor and, as we sat in the air-conditioned office, I pointed to the beads of sweat rolling down my forehead and asked: 'Does this seem normal to you?' ",5,3
my wife is 44 and was diagnosed with EBV 6 weeks ago and she still has a swollen painful neck and fatigue. She has now developed a cough and her chest hurts when she initially wakes up but it slowly goes away. Is this normal? She has auto-immune diseases so we are very concerned about taking her to the hospital due to the covid-19. Just flying a little blind right now and could use some advise.,1,0
"Let's post some positive mono recovery stories so that they're all in one place to give people encouragement. I think there's a negative post bias that understandably happens where most people post when they're concerned, but not when they've recovered. This can give someone viewing the posts a pessimistic impression of recovery. ",0,0
"On the other hand reading someone's recovery story, including the darkest parts of the illness, can give hope and aid in the healing process.",0,0

Thanks Jessie and a great idea. Any internet search often highlights the bad side of this illness. I started blogging to try and pass on good tips.,1.773333333,1
Like many on here I was in the same boat struggling for months with glandular fever / mono and unsure if I would ever get better. However I was able to make a full and complete recovery despite a really difficult I would say 9 months in particular.,5,3
"Please don't be discouraged by reading that because everyone's recovery is different, many recovery much quicker and the first few weeks / months is always by far the worst.",0,0
"So my message to anyone having a difficult time with mono at the moment would be to remember that it definitely does pass over, sometimes it can take a bit of time, but it does. I was able to get back to full health after that and live a normal and active life again which I'm grateful for.",5,3
"Thanks for sharing that Craig, inspirational as always. How long until you were completely back to normal?",0.333333333,0
"Thanks for the message and just hoping you are feeling okay and just want to say that was a great idea to set up a page where people can post positive and encouraging stories, it's such a hard virus to deal with and it's important people know there is hope and recovery at the end of the road for everyone reading this who is or has been struggling with mono / glandular fever and just feels weary and tired and scared, which is more than understandable given the circumstances.",1.66,1
"It is different for everyone, for me I would say the biggest turning point came around after 9 months, and although it still took a little while after then to feel completely normal I was able to live a much more normal life from then on, so long as I paced myself and still took care. It did still take me a while to get back working full time again",2.666666667,1
"I think my confidence and things were shaken a bit too in that respect, and it's important to phase things in and not just jump back in to the deep end, I think that definitely helps.",0.333333333,0
"Everyone is different though, some people recover quicker, and often it's a zig-zag kind of recovery, where sometimes you can get mini set backs and wonder if you're back to square one - be assured that you're not if feeling that way today it's just part of the recovery process, and you definitely will get better - there is hope and recovery for everyone with this horrible virus, your body eventually gets on top of it and then it can harm you no more!",1.66,1
I think that's where my confidence and mood was knocked; the zig zag/ forwards and backwards of the recovery. You learn not to get your hopes up when you have a manageable day because you could have a horrible one the day after. It's really hard to accept and believe that your making progress hey!,3.333333333,2
"I'm currently at the 9 month mark and at the moment I have more good days than bad and feeling stronger and more like myself. Can I ask, how much longer it took until you felt fully recovered?",2.666666667,1
"You're welcome Ste, thinking about you and believing you will get through this and get better, without any doubt whatsoever.",0,0
I hope my experience can help others to see there is light at the end of the tunnel. It's a massive step for me to say that out loud and offer advise because it's been a long time coming as I am almost 10 months into recovery.,3.333333333,2
"I started to feel very unwell May 2016, back and forth to the doctors but didn't find out it was glandular fever until July. I also believe if I had of rested earlier I would maybe not have suffered so bad but because it took two months for a diagnosis I carried on working and working out, which absolutely ruined me.",5,3
"I had a horrific summer swollen glands, couldn't eat, couldn't move, in agony... sure you all know. Could barely make it to the toilet. Sent to anger clinics because I had so many lumps in my neck. Literally thought this was it. Flashbacks to the worst of it and me screaming in agony, thinking I couldn't go on and if I ever recovered I would never, ever take movement and life for granted again.",5,3
"By September I was moving around the house more but I well and truly paid for it, I would be in agony, muscles would spasm and I would barley be able to move. Began to really loose hope that I would get better. As well as being ill, it's like you said... I lost a part of myself to it. I would see my reflection and cry because I would look terminally ill and did not recognise myself. Life was about surviving minute by minute.",4,3
By October I was forced back to work because of my living situation. I had no choice and it took everything I had to keep it up. A few weeks in and had a MASSIVE break down which was detrimental to my recovery and admitted to work how I wasn't coping. This took a lot of anxiety away but my mood was beginning to suffer as it had been dragging on for so long I began to get depressed. Somehow I made it to the Christmas break.,5,3
After Xmas had another mini melt down because I think you put so much pressure on yourself ' I will be better by then' etc and when your not it just wrecked havoc with my anxiety.,4.666666667,3
I kept pushing through. I think the worst is it's not a smooth straight recovery. It goes from a good minute out of the day. To a good hour or two. Then to oh today's been manageable. And now I'm at a few days have been okay. But then the next might make you crash and remind you your not there quiet yet.,3.333333333,2
"It's been the hardest nine months of my life. The GF throat and sickness disappears after a few months although I have nerve damage in my neck because of it so on medication for that. It's the fatigue, the pain and agony, just functioning destroys my body let alone get through day to day life.",5,3
I kept regularly visiting my doctor which I highly recommend and he referred me to the pain clinic which helps very much so. I have also had a chronic fatigue assessment and they said although they are on the fence they believe this is still post viral fatigue and even though it 10 months on it's a very short term in grand scheme of chronic pain and fatigue.,5,3
I remember reading something on a chat room saying someone had GF and CF and what saved them was cardio and I thought are you serious. What sort of advise is that to somebody who can barley make it upstairs or down the street.,1.66,1
I am still struggling. I am still in recovery. I still don't feel 100% me and I hate photos been taken because I still don't think I look like me and I still feel like a sick person.,4,3
It's been very very hard because you have to be mindful and all the services tell you to take every little thing as a positive and focus on how FAR you have come not how FAR you have to go. I find this hard. I think the best advise I could give (but have found it hard to follow myself) was to pace yourself and see every single thing as a positive. ,1,0
"Once you start having thought of attempting to do things do it. It took me, as I said, 1-2 months for a gentle jog to not destroy me after. You just have to get to a point where you listen to your body but then ignore it's attempts to stall you too. Because CF is all about our pain receptors been damaged thanks to virus so they are constantly in fight or flight activation mode.",4.666666667,3
I am still a fair few months off a full recovery and I don't believe it will be until the summer (I hope). Doctors like to say weeks but when you talk to other people it is more like months/year. It's so hard not to be hard on yourself and some days are manageable some you have to stay in bed and not move. I just refuse to let it turn into something bigger!!!,5,3
It's not days/ weeks but I'll say each month you get a little bit closer and a little bit closer. I think if I wasn't forced into work I'm not sure where I would be now. If I would of had a quicker recover or if I would of struggled to keep moving because I didn't have too. I think when you take that next step (work or exercise) do know it will make you feel worse. It will be very very hard but just keep pushing through and listen to your body.,3.666666667,2
"I also take lots of vitamins, b12 is advised for GF I also take D3 and omega 3 and iron. All highly advised for GF / CF suffers. Healthy diet is also advised and I swear I read that dairy, wheat and red meat etc can make you worse I don't know. I also have a monthly deep tissue massage which really helps and have been advised acupuncture but have yet to try it.",5,3
"As you can see, it's been a very long time for me and I'm still struggling. Make sure you have someone you can talk to and a good support network. Chase your doctor into referrals too so you can get the right support there. The biggest thing I clung on to was that the fact there is improvement. Even if it is 1% each month is a POSITIVE. Because if it had turned into chronic fatigue /ME you would see NO improvement after six months. Or decline. So hold on to that and keep going.",4,3
Inspirational once again Sophie - vitamins and nerbs such as Omega 3 definitely helpful would highly recommend.,1.66,1
Thank you for sharing your journey in such detail. I tested positive for an EBV infection in early March but quite sure I contracted it in mid January.,5,3
"I was in great shape before I got Ill and have always considered my body as my temple....so having an invader take over like this is so hard to take psychologically due to the lack of control and certainly and then of course the physical symptoms, which as you say....worrying that they will morph into something more serious....",4,3

hope your finally back to yourself by now  i know your posts rather old but thought id ask....how did your doctor check your neck for nerve damage? I mentioned this to my doc & he said GF doesnt affect your nerves?? I think this could be the case with me? ,5,3

"I am a 14 year old boy in eight grade, And my mono story has been confusing for me and weird. So far I have felt unwell for about 4 months, and I first started feeling a bit more out of energy than usual in Middle - Late  January, and it wasn’t anything much",5,3
" I kept playing in my basketball games and practices, But I still felt a bit unwell and tired doing it, So this feeling stayed for a few days, and we went to the doctor and wanted to see if anything was wrong, he said he will test me for mono, but he doubts I have it because I would have more symptoms by now and I would be more tired.",5,3
"So we got the test results back about 5 days later, and I had the same feeling of “i feel a bit more tired and out of energy than usual”. But once my mom told me I had mono I immediately felt worse and then I actually started feeling sick, That week I felt a lot worse, (tho I never felt as bad as most people describe mono to be) and I didn’t have much of an appetite and that. ",5,3
I feel about the same as I did in the beginning of March and that has scared me because I have read some stuff on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and how mono can turn into it,3.333333333,2
"i am very scared about that, also mentally I am always stressed and sometimes sad, and there is never a moment throughout the day where I don’t think about my mono.",5,3
"I would expect to be healthy by now considering that my symptoms have been somewhat mild, as I haven’t had to miss school, but it’s already been 4 months and my friend who had mono right before me had to miss 3 weeks of school but was fully healthy by 2 months.",5,3
"And as a kid the thought of CFS and that I could get that is very scary. As of right now i feel better than how I felt at the worst of my setback, but I don’t feel back on track and I just keep feeling ups and downs (and the same amount of energy as I had in March). ",4,3
sometimes I feel like it’s just going to to downhill and not get better. i also want to play on the basketball team this coming year (it starts in October) but right now I’m not sure how long it will take to recover and I am always stressed about it. It helps to hear everyone’s stories though.,4,3

"I really want to encourage and reassure you that what you're going through is normal for the virus, it's so frustrating as recovery is often very zig-zag with it, you feel a little better one day or week",1.66,1
Please please let me reassure you regarding CFS - it took me 9-10 months really to see a major breakthrough in my recovery and thanks to God's help made a full recovery. ,4.666666667,3
 it is very normal to go through what you've been going through and then make a full recovery - I know it's hard when you read these scare stories on the internet.,1.66,1
"One thing that helped me is remembering that 90%+ of the western world has been infected with EBV (virus that causes mono), most as a child or baby when they don't really get the full whack of the symptoms, but 90%+ are fit and healthy and don't have CFS. ",0.666666667,0
"Getting plenty of rest and not pushing yourself too much with sports and things is important too - frustrating I know, but do still do things you enjoy like seeing friends, going for walks, etc, that's really important too, just don't overdo things and rest when you need to. Taking a good strong multi-vitamin per day can be helpful too and getting even Vitamin C and B vitamins can also be really helpful.",1.66,1
"Thanks so much for the response and it was very encouraging, So far my setback has lasted about 3 weeks and it’s not really improving yet which worries me that I might just have to go through all this over again and all the progress I made was a waste.",3,2
How long did it take you until you were fully able to be active and workout and stuff again? ,0,0
Also if I do anything that’s somewhat active (like jump up to grab something) then immediately I feel worse after. Anyways thanks for the help and it’s awesome that your still helping peoole who have mono out 12 years after you had it.,2.666666667,1
"It's totally understandable that you feel the way you do having been going through this for so many months, it's so hard I know. ",1.66,1

 I’m glad you have responded to me and I bet all the other people have too. You show lots of empathy as someone who has went through it and even though you don’t have it anymore you still think about the people who have it right now and try to help them out which is an awesome thing to do and it shows what type of person you really are.,0.666666667,0
Also I wanted to ask is it possible to only recover a certain amount and stop there instead of fully recovering and getting back to normal health? ,1,0
Well it says more about you I think that you took the time to say those kind and lovely words to me even though you have been feeling so unwell yourself!! I only know how awful and horrible this virus affected me and really want to reassure you and anyone going through it that there is hope and recovery and it doesn't last forever!,5,3
"I worried in the same way as you when after 6-7 months I felt only a little better as if that was as good as things were going to get, that my new best was not going to be anything like my old self and would have to get used to this new 'normal'. ",1,0
"Let me reassure you that it is normal to feel like that right now, and that things do GET FULLY better, sometimes this phase feels like it can go on for so long staying at the same level for ages, but then with me and lots of other people there seems to be a sudden step forward in a short space of time. That happens for a lot of people, and for others it's more a gradual zig-zag but overall upwards recovery.",3.333333333,2
"Sorry for rambling a bit, but in short, from my knowledge and experience of the virus, you are absolutely going to get back to FULL HEALTH and not just reach a certain level and plateau. ",1.66,1
"I felt exactly the same as though this was happening, but then a few months down the line things had changed and improved a lot. So remember sometimes it's just a time factor, which I know doesn't help when already been going through it for 6 months - such a long time I know - but remember you are going to make a full recovery and have lots of happy and healthy times ahead!!",3,2
"Thinking about you and remember get plenty of rest and it's only natural that your confidence would be affected by this - mines was too but it does come back as you start to get better, rest assured trusting God that will happen Young Boy!

"So far my setback has been about 3 weeks, and haven’t really seen improvements in it or any signs of starting to get back to where I was. ",3,2
"I remember before I had my setback I was feeling as though it was improving, where I could go outside and shoot around (like shoot a basketball), without feeling worse (unless I do it for to long). But if I did any running or jogging at all I would immediately feel worse.",4,3
"But back to my setback, right now I feel about the same as I did like 3 months ago, and I don’t know when I will be back to where I was because i gained the symptoms that I had 3 months ago like forgetfulness, a bit of joint stiffness, and occasional headaches.",4,3
Also my endurance has gone way down where before I could walk for miles without feeling much worse but now if I walk around town just a little bit I will feel worse the next day. ,3.666666667,2
So I’m worried that it will take me another 3 months to get back to where I was because I feel significantly worse and no signs of improvement.,3,2
 How did setbacks/crashes go for you? ,0,0
"Just wondering because this is my first setback so far as before it was just very gradual improvements monthly, with ups and downs as days go by but this time it was it slowly got worse for a bit and hasn’t gotten better. ",3,2

"My experience is that the virus generally doesn't work like that, that recovery is very zig-zag, up and down and unexplained. So you could have a setback for a month or whatever and then suddenly move a big step forward again, and then it can go back and forth - but remember overall it's going to be like a graph which goes up and down but the overall trend you see is going up - and sometimes even with an upwards graph you get those low peaks, if that makes sense.",4.666666667,3

"This breakthrough is coming for you too I truly believe that, don't panic if it still takes a bit of time to get fully better, or if the setback continues a little longer, it can happen but ABSOLUTELY this won't last forever and you WILL get back to full health and make a full recovery.",0,0

 I am not sure what to tell you except I am happy to message you my story...shortened version and how I got diagnosed. But basically I was diagnosed by an immunologist after failing to get anywhere with rheumatology...gastroenterology or a neuro. I knew there was an underlying problem for me but it was a very difficult road to diagnosis.,5,3
 With blood tests please have them check ai markers like esr crp and ana. These can give some clues though frustratingly not always out of whack even for me when there is intense disease activity.,3,2
hi yes my crp was 20. After the virus need to see my repeat result. But they saying nothing physical too. I honestly dont know any more!,4.666666667,3

There is no test for Occipital Neurolgia. Your doctor would give you a nerve block shot and it will either help or do nothing. If you have ON then you would have pain that can run from the base of your neck up and over the top of your head. You neck muscles on the left and or right side will also be tight and sore. It's worth investigating if you have those symptoms.,0,0

"I went to thailand two months ago, and on my connecting flight in South Korea, I decided to put in my contact lenses. After putting them in, I felt a sense of disorientation, dizziness, where I thought I was having heat exhaustion.",4,3
"When I arrived in Thailand, it happened twice more, every other morning when I first put them in, a sense of wooziness and dizziness occured but would go away. My very last night in Thailand i put my contacts in and felt dizzy again for an hour, and was fine, later went out to dinner then all of a sudden I got so dizzy, I started having a panic attack.",4.333333333,3
"No one knew what was wrong with me...that night I took my contact lenses out and still felt horrible. Like I was disoriented, couldn't focus, like my vision was weird, I started having head pressure as well. This feeling never went away and I still have it two months later straight.",4,3

"I've gotten every test under the sun. I've done Lymes, every infectious disease in thailand, vitamin panel, caloric test for the inner ear, got checked for BPPV, no migraine in my family or history of it, so that didn't make sense. Had a clean MRI on brain and neck...",5,3

"Hi Stufon, I think your dizziness was almost certainly triggered initially by using the wrong contact lens in one of your eyes.",0,0
"I would recommend that you have your eyes tested as soon as possible, and have new glasses made using your new prescription. Once you've got the new glasses you should give yourself time for your brain to adjust to them, and possibly expect some initial dizziness. I think you would also be well advised to steer clear of contacts for a while, but if you feel you can't do without them, make absolutely sure they are made to your current prescription, and NEVER wear them in the wrong eye.",0,0
I don't think your dizziness is due to anything more sinister than becoming intolerant to glasses or lenses that aren't exactly right for you.,0,0

"Given that you're 25 I'm guessing that you'll only need single vision lenses which is good, as varifocals present the brain's visual cortex with a far more complex problem to get used to, and would be far more likely to produce dizziness and nausea, given that you're balance system seems to be very sensitive to unexpected changes to visual input.",0,0

hello I have been wearing contacts since I was 13 and I'm now 38 . I had to stop wearing my contacts because I was having issues with them so I went to glasses for a while and now every time I put my contacts on I get that crazy feeling so it could be just the difference from switching to glasses to contacts since I was predominantly only ever wearing contacts before .,5,3

just wondering what your current contact lenses prescription is? Did it change or stay the same for both eyes? And did the ophthalmologist and optometrist confirm that wearing the wrong contact lenses caused the dizziness? Or was it unrelated?,0,0
Mine is 3.50 in one eye and 3.00 in the other. I decided to wear the 3.50 in both one day and I screwed up and got symptoms..I wonder if it triggered it or something else...And I saw both physicians and they couldnt find the problem which lead me to believe it was migraine causing these issues. ,5,3

"I have had the exact same thing happen to me. I have worn glasses and contacts for 40 years. I went in for a routine eye exam and was placed in multifocal contacts and glasses. since then, I have been dizzy 24/7. It's like a floating, movement and woozy sensation. Looking at TVs, cell phones and computers makes it worse. It has. changed my life dramatically.",5,3
 I was going through a lot in the period before the eye exam and 4 days prior had my first panic attack ever.,5,3
The theory is that the dizziness the new contacts caused triggered the event and my brain could not handle the drastic change in contact lens prescription. I then became obsessed and focused and terrified of the dizziness this creating the loop for the vicious cycle of fear and anxiety and dizziness. This is called PPPD. I would love to talk to you.

I've been diagnosed for over a year now and think my symptoms started because of my brain failing to adapt to varifocals after years of wearing single vision specs. Hope this helps.,5,3
Hi Brian. I am in the group. so you also have had a similar experience with contacts? Strangest thing ever. How are you doing?,1,0
Do you feel anxiety was a cause for your inability to compensate and adjust? ,0,0
 I can't discount that i had a panic attack 3 days be getting new lenses but i dont know if my anxiety would have gotten to this level had I not gone in and had such a big prescription change. also i reacted to the dizziness by freaking out and became so scared so i know that didn't help and was probably my trigger.,5,3
My trigger appears to have been wearing varifocals for the first time after only ever using single vision glasses.,5,3
" As for anxiety, I had my share of that in the beginning, always worried that something awful and life-threatening was wrong with me, which I'm sure contributed to the dizziness, but now I'm not anxious at all most of the time, but the dizziness I experience hasn't gone away, in fact if anything it's worse than ever.",4.666666667,3
it’s so weird that you were all mentioning panic attacks. Because when The dizziness comes on I also start to get a little short of breath and my heart rate goes up. ,4,3

I've just joined hoping to get some advice about liver pain I've been having recently.,4,3
"32 year old Male, have been drinking regularly since college. For the past say 5 years anyway I would drink typically 5 days a week, sometimes more.",1.666666667,1
"I would drink heavily pretty much every friday & Saturday, and also drink 3/4 nights during the week (three double measures of rum on a weekday).",3,2
"I'm sure there are people out there who drink more than that but I'm conscious I have been a chronic drinker for the guts of a decade, and have rarely ever gave my liver more than a couple of days to rest.",2.333333333,1
I have known that I drink too often but up until recently it hasn't caused me any outward problems (that were obvious to me). ,2.666666667,1
For the past few months however I have been conscious of a 'stiff' feeling in my upper right abdomen. I had a binge period recently where I drank moderately heavy for 10 days straight (at least a few measures of rum or a bottle of wine e.g.) and I woke up with mild pain in my liver.,4,3
This has worries the hell out of obviously. I stayed off drink for a few days and felt it progressively better. On the fourth day I ventured a drink again and had a bottle of wine - again waking up with liver pain.,4,3
"So now i know I have a bit of a problem on my hands, but I just want to know if you guys have any advice from your experiences.",1.333333333,1
 I'm panicking I have gave myself cirrhosis over the years without realising. I have read that you can develop it without showing symptoms and only realise too late?,4.333333333,3
"I have no other symptoms apart from the mild liver pain lately (always noticed most when laying flat in bed). No jaundice, nausea, itching, unusual poo etc. ",4,3
Although I have noticed a pretty loud gurgling/percolating type noise from my gut and bubbling sensation in the liver area too.,4,3
I figure i need to abstain for a while at least anyway.. aiming to go alcohol free for a month and see how I feel. ,2,1
 I should also book a doc appointment and explain the situation I know. ,4,3
I did have bloods taken for an unrelated matter three years ago and do recall the doc noting that the blood sample indicated normal liver function at that point anyway.,5,3
"I am reasonably healthy otherwise. Okay diet, exercise regularly, good BMI.",1.333333333,1
Hope someone can shed some light at what I might be looking at here.,0,0
With your age and drinking history it's highly unlikely you have cirrhosis so don't worry,0,0
I've had liver pain in the past too and high blood scores etc (yes from drinking) and it's because your liver is swollen which..ok isn't ideal but it can and very likely will totally recover at this stage. ,4.333333333,3
Giving up for a month is a good idea and your pain will almost certainly be gone by then though it can take a while.,0,0
 I haven't had a drink for over two months now and mine's totally gone.,1.333333333,1
You may also notice that sugary and high fat foods trigger the pain (i.e. they're bad for your liver) You may also want to take a supplement.,1.66,1
 I took something called 'LivPlus' from Amazon which definitely helped with the pain.,4.333333333,3
You'll be fine but good luck.,0,0

great reply to Patrick and i never had liver problems or pains when i drank. stopped 7 years 3 months ago and never looked back.,2,1

"So i have similar from time to time and ive had it fully investigated with blood test, ultrasound and then a ct scan. I'm due to have an upper GI scan to investigate further.",5,3
The ultrasound actually didnt show issues with the liver. The CT scan showed cysts and a fatty liver but my GP said that the level i have wouldnt cause liver pain. ,5,3
 I have no gall stones but there is something where your gall bladder can spasm causing gurgling/wind type pain and a dull ache in the upoer right abdomen.,1.66,1
Do you get pain in your back too? When mine is sore when i bend it hurts.,4,3
i had my cholesterol tested showing that is high which i believe is caused by my alcohol intake over the years. ,5,3
" I didnt realise booze contributed to this but its does, which can then cause gall bladder issues and fatty liver.",1.66,1
Im sure you dont have scarring but maybe asked for a scan. Hard atm with the coronovirus outbreak but maybe get on a waiting list.,0,0
Also if you can just cut down the booze a bit more to as sounds like that is hellping you. I have big time and my pain is very rare now.,0.666666667,0
I've just registered on this site because I'm in a very similar situation to you and I'm also looking for help. ,0.333333333,0
" I've been a pretty heavy drinker for 10+ years. From the sounds of it I might be a bit further along though, by which I mean I think I've done more damage and am having more symptoms.",4,3
" For example it sounds like I drink more than you and I've been getting these twinges in my liver, plus itching around my liver, for maybe 5 years. ",4,3
They've significantly worsened recently (and quite quickly) after a bout of increased drinking and now I'm pretty much feeling them constantly even when going for days without a drink.,3,2
" I'm also feeling generally more tired, bloated quite easily, I feel there is a little swelling around my liver and I had quite bad heartburn the morning after my last drink.",4,3
"I've had a doctor's appointment too recently and his advice was first to have a blood test and then to look at other tests, such as ultrasounds and fibrascans on my liver.",5,3
The reason I'm telling you this is I think you're right to be worried but I also think you're in a good position to stop and even reverse any damage done. ,0,0
"As I understand it there is a stage before cirrhosis called fatty liver disease which may be reversible, whereas cirrhosis isn't.",0,0

"I saw my dr this morning and she said she COULD do a cat scan to look, but felt like it sounded like trapped gas more than anything because it comes and goes and isn’t related to food.",4.666666667,3
"She pushed around on my belly and liver felt nice and small as it should be and felt nothing of concern, maybe a slight hiatal hernia that I get due to stress.  ",3.333333333,2
It started about a week ago at 4 in the morning and just felt like trapped gas at that point.  Ate a peppermint and passed gas a few times and it slowly subsided-maybe 10 minutes later because I fell asleep.  ,3.666666667,2
" Woke with no more pain, but within a few hours of being awake (and toast with butter and cinnamon along with coffee no cream), the twinge was back.  ",3,2
 I would call it a 2-3 on the pain scale.  I can completely ignore it and function without it bothering me.  ,3,2
 It comes and goes and it doesn’t matter if I eat before or not.  I have been avoiding fat all week just thinking if it WAS gallbladder this would help it move on.  But it still comes and goes. ,2,1
"I’ll feel it more when I take a deep breath in,  but again, more like a noticeable pull rather than pain.",2,1
"I tend to freak out and think the worst, so that’s why even though it’s so slight I went to see my dr.  I’m imagining it being gallbladder and killing me with only the slight warning and not much pain. ",5,3
"We have no insurance so a ct scan will be super expensive and I am hesitant to do it because my dr says she really doesn’t anticipate it because I’m 39, 115 lbs, eat salads and turkey sandwiches and baked or grilled chicken and roasted veggies for dinner...not a diet that would cause issues. ",4.666666667,3
She thinks my anxiety is getting the best of me and digestive enzymes is what she recommends for now unless it gets worse or no better.  ,4.666666667,3
" My neck and upper back has been tight due to poor sleeping posture, but not related to the lower under right rib pain-neck only hurts when I turn my head a certain way where the rib twinge is more when I breath in deep.  ",4,3
I know there will be the random odd case that was mild pain and ended up needing surgery...but typically all I hear are attacks that are very painful and last a day after eating a fatty meal and then subside until they give in to surgery.  ,1.66,1
Just hoping for some input.  Do I push for the scan or just ride this out for a while since it’s not severe pain? ,4.333333333,3
Are you in America Lindsey?,0,0
"I’m waiting to see a gastroenterologist regarding my pain, I have the upper right quadrant pain, I get pain in that area the minute I eat, it sort of feels like the bile is struggling to get through.",5,3
" I’m in Scotland, so a scan would be free here, but our National Health Service is in a mess, it will probably be too expensive for them to give me one. ",4,3
"If I were you you, I would get one, it’s amazing what these scans can reveal and it would put your mind at ease. ",0,0
Hi Lindsey sorry to hear you are having possible gallbladder pains.,0,0
In my opinion without a ultrasound it would be very hard to determine if you have gallstones or a gallbladder dieasse. I had my Gallbladder removed last week.,5,3
I had six years of if's and buts till I got the ultrasound done and they confirmed gallstones they found afew in there and I large one.,5,3
"I wouldn't stress to much as this is very common, it's seems like you are getting mild pains a gallbladder attack which I had around 5 times is an extreme pain and usual you will end up in Hospital A&E.",3,2
"For now cut out fatty foods, fried foods alcohol fizzy drinks and see how you get on and don't eat before you go to bed.",0,0
I'm not a doctor I'm giving you my life experience with gallstones.,4,3
The pain normally starts below your right lower rip then slowly move to the centre it can last for 1 to 5 hours it's a horrible pain that will make a man cry.,1.66,1
I had an ultrasound and a ct scan done about 18 months ago for a different issue and they saw no stones there.  ,5,3
" But i know, that means nothing now.",0,0
"The dr said a ct scan would be better and if that showed nothing, then a HIDA scan would be her next option.",1.66,1
"But again...I really hate to spend the money if that’s not at all what’s going on.  I don’t feel sick after I eat, I don’t get increased pains after I eat.  It just this slight pull.",2.666666667,1
Almost feels like muscular because it’s more related to a pulling feeling.  ,1.66,1
I have not ever had pain strong enough to even consider taking anything for it.  It just feels almost like a fullness or a small stretched bubble.  I don’t feel it at all until I take a deep breath in,2,1
"A ct scan will be close to $2000, and then the scan is an additional $400.  So it’s not a small cost for us.  I just don’t want to be neglecting it either.  ",3,2
It just doesn’t sound at all typical to gall bladder aside from the location.  ,1.66,1
"Hi Lindsey that's great that you don't have gallstones. Are you sure it's not some sort of muscler issues you have, maybe just a muscle spasm try not to stress yourself out to much about it. ",0,0
Why don't you leave it awhile and see how you get on.,0,0
THIS is just my opinion.,0,0
Where abouts in the world are you that's a lot of money to spend in a scan.,0,0
I’m in the US.  I have no insurance so I have to pay out of pocket.  Sometimes there are great discounts...but it’s still very costly. ,1.333333333,1
It definitely could be muscular related because I hold my gut tightly when I’m stressed...and I have definitely been stressed A LOT. ,4,3
So it’s definitely a possibility that what I’m feeling is an overused abdominal muscle that I haven’t been able to relax completely.  ,3.666666667,2
Kind of like when you do sit ups and your abs hurt...mine are the upper area and I develop an actual knot in my stomach because things tighten so much.  ,4,3
 It takes time for me to breathe deep and relax for several days before I can unlock that knot.  So the rib cage feeling could definitely be part of that too.  ,4,3
"Again, if pain got worse, I’d definitely do the scan.  It just isn’t double me over type of pain that so many describe.",4,3
Well I had my gallbladder removed on Sunday after months of numbing pains in my shoulder and neck which stretches into my head and causes migraines,5,3
"As I write this, I’m in hospital again after being constantly sick with the runs, my chest hurts and they think I have an infection",5,3
" I also have a hiatus hernia which causes me trouble always. Get everything seen to whilst you can, that’s my advice. When it goes wrong it will be when you least expect it or can afford it x",5,3
"All my symptoms started with severe pulling right side right below rib cage, I got a severe Charlie horse one day working out which gave me pulling all the time, couldn’t even bend down with it cramping up",4,3
" I went through several tests, mri to see if I tore my abdominal wall and was all normal. Had ct, scopes and any test you could think of which one just pick up a dialated common duct which could not further due to ins denial. ",5,3
"My scope revealed ulcer, gastritis and I was treated with poi for months, the problem continued and food started to become a huge problem as I was getting severe stomach bloating, gas and burping 24/7.",5,3
I begged my gi to further this and I got hida scan which revealed 5% functioning gallbladder.it was removed right away and I’m 3 wks post op and that pulling is finally starting to go away. I hope this helped you,5,3
"Oh and forgot to mention that my ct and mri showed normal gallbladder, hida scan is the test needed.",4.666666667,3
Did your burping and bloating symptoms went away?,0,0
"lindsey, idk if you ever got any answers or not. I just googled something stuck under my right rib and this blog came up. ",1.66,1
 I've been dealing with it for 3 years now and have even had my gallbladder removed and no relief whatsoever.,5,3
My GI doctor seems to think that it's sphincter of Oddie dysfunction. from what I've read it's rare and very hard to diagnose. ,5,3
in order to diagnose it the procedure they have to do is just about as invasive as the surgery to fix it. anyway I hope this helps look it up and see if it matches your symptoms,0,0

hi Chris...sorry to jump on your forum but i was also diagnosed with ferretin levels of 2000 back in august/september last year here in London...after 25 + weekly venesections my ferretin has dropped to 180...,5,3

They have now completely stopped my venesections as the genetic testing indicated that i may also have ALAS2 which is Sideroblastic anaemia and my bone marrow is not reproducing the blood that i am losing from the weekly venesections.,5,3

My doctor ended up recommending Imiquimod Cream. I would use it 3 times a week and on the days that I didn’t use it I would just apply organic apple cider vinegar. ,5,3
They were gone in a week and 4 days. Even tough they were gone I would still apply the cream like I normally would. ,2.666666667,1
The apple cider vinegar may hurt depending where you apply it but it actually helps kill the wart. It turns them white and then they turn black after 2 days and after that the spots fade away,1.66,1

My worry is my mother who works at Brigham and women's hospital in Boston has been feeling quite weak with chills and I'm worried I have contracted it from her.,3.666666667,2
I had some chills last night and some stomach pain and diarrhea yesterday morning but it quickly went away and I believed it was from the food the night before.,4,3
 Now today I have had abdominal pain since I've woken up and it has been constant. I figure food poisoning doesn't usually last more than a day so now I am really concerned.,4,3
I've read abdominal pain and chills can be really early signs of the coronavirus but of course I won't be able to get tested until my symptoms become more severe. ,4,3
Certainly. I've been monitoring my breathing and I seem fine. However from what I read half the patients in China initially displayed GI problems and abdominal pain. Hopefully it's just a fluke and my anxiety is just getting to me.,3,2

Idk what’s going on. I tried going to sleep Friday night and was in agonizing pain and couldn’t sleep so I went to the emergency room. ,5,3

Anyone else suffered from over active bladder? ,4,3
Has anyone tried diet rememdies? When my overactive bladder was driving me crazy I found out my sugar levels were very high and I started researching diets and stumbled upon diets that were low inflammation diets. The diet was from a nurse who argued that over active bladder is from an inflamed bladder and reducing inflammaiton was key. ,4,3

I have suffered with overactive bladder and Bartholin Cysts since my teenage years!! I am a 48 year old woman and it has been a recurring issue with very little information from any of my doctors. I had a marcup. a year and a half ago and the gland is starting to swell as I enter into a new relationship. My doctor has no advice other than stay tuned until it absesses again. ,5,3

i have noticed that when my stress level starts to go up it will cause the bartholin area to become slightly swollen (even when i am not sexually active).,4,3
i cant say i have ever found an easy solution but with a combination of a few things i have learned how to take control and sometimes prevent the abcess and having to get it drained. ,3.333333333,2
when i notice the area starting to get inflamed or swollen or filling up i take very hot showers and i use soap with no fragrance and wash my hands then i go in the opening of my vagina and try to scrape out or completley wipe out any build up.,4,3
sometimes there is nothing blocking the area and its just swollen for what seems like no reason at all. ,1.66,1
if it gets bigger then i know its filling up with abcess. ,1.66,1

A few weeks later I was hit with another fever and body aches. This time I was diagnosed with bacterial tonsillitis and given more antibiotics that cleared it up. I also had blood testsand a chest xray around this time.,5,3

First I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Admittedly my diet wasn't picture perfect as I was eating a lot more (bad and oily) carbs to try to curb morning sickness. ,5,3
but my BMI is right at the bottom so nit iverweight or anything like that. The only number that was out was fasting and it was only ever out by .3 at the most! ,1,0
i ended up on insulin for fasting. when I gave birth to my daughter she was born insulin dependent (i had too much insulin in my body and bloody regret ever going on it).,5,3
Anyway I felt pretty good - bub and I were healthy until one day when I woke up i had this wierd vision disturbance for 15 mins until I ate something. ,4,3
nothing followed went to the doctor and she diagnosed a visual migraine. perfect was on my way and didn't bother me. ,5,3
 until the next night same thing happened with the addition of pins and needles and complete out of body experience. ,4,3
went to hospital and everything as I thought I was having a stroke. diagnosed as panick attack. this is where my health worries started. ,5,3
"I am going to list below all my symptoms, tests done, and the what my current worry is.",5,3

Symptoms in order of getting them:,1.66,1

Bone and joint pain especially in knees - tests done included a battery of blood tests and ultrasound on knee and xray on knee.,1.66,1
"they checked specifically for lyme disease a full blood count, autoimmune and inflamatory markers. All normal.",1.66,1
Found lumps on my hip bone and shin bone - ultrasound found a cyst and fatty deposits.,5,3
Nausea - found I had a tummy virus (from stool tests).,5,3
Neck pain - ultrasound found somewhat enlarged thyroid gland and thyroid nodules but all looked normal.,1.66,1
additional Neck pain and lymph nodes especially one above collar bone - ultrasound showed all normal and called superficial lymph nodes and because I am skinny can feel them more.,5,3
Chest pain + pain in back and lymph node under arm (or maybe fatty deposits) and boob lump - boob ultrasound and under arm ultrasound as well as chest xray - clear/normal.,1.66,1
"Pain under (below) both ribs, indigestion, food going down slowly, and severe pain in bag - suspected gall stones so abdominal ultrasound of liver, gallbladder, and pancreas - Clear. also have had about 3 ECG's. have a slightly high cholesterol count but that is improving (it's hereditary).",5,3
Now I still have the pain bellow rib cage on both sides and an uncomfortable feeling below sternum. pain can be quite bad and quite sharp on left hand side. ,4,3

My last hope is to see a Lyme disease / tick disease specialist. Maybe they can find something. I remember getting really bad tick like bites a few months before the encounter. Maybe the antibiotics triggered an immune system response to lyme.,5,3

I had half my prostate (one lobe) ablated with HIFU in 2018 I too have suffered from reduction in girth and length of penis when flaccid.,5,3

I agree with barney34. Removing the cancer was the top priority for me too,5,3

I see so many posts on here about constant or provoked vulva pain that I thought it might be useful if I explained vulvodynia and how I cured mine,5,3
Vulvodynia literally means vulvar pain and is a condition of the nerves in that area. The nerves have become hyperactive and hypersensitive due to trauma which can be chemical or physical in source or due to infection.,0,0
"I think mine was due to persistent thrush infection and the many remedies I tried to cure it, including home remedies such as bathing in a bath with some cider vinegar in - that made my soreness much worse (chemical trauma).",5,3
Good for you for pursuing a cure. Luckily I don't have pain. I think your post may help those who do.,1.666666667,1
"Very interesting to see how you cured your vulvadynia, and sorry to hear you had such a difficult time.  I suffered from the constant itch and pain for about seven years, with it getting gradually worse and the doctors treating me for many different things and no relief.  ",5,3
"My breakthrough came about when I had a bout of gastroenteritis and couldn't eat for about four days.  During that time my vulvadynia eased, until by the third day the symptoms had entirely disappeared.  That gave me the hint that my problem might be diet-based.  ",5,3
"I gradually reintroduced foods over the next week, and found that the symptoms slammed back about one hour after I ate some potato.  I cut out potato and the symptoms again eased, coming back whenever I ate potatos relatives, the other Solanacea plants of tomato, chilli, bell peppers or capsicum, and eggplants. ",3,2
"All of these plants are closely related to the Deadly Nightshade, or Belladonna plant.  It seems that as I grew older I could no longer de-toxify any of this family of foods, and by the time I reached menopause the problem had grown chronic.  ",5,3
Now i avoid all of these foods and I am absolutely symptom-free. ,2.666666667,1
" I think of all the various things that doctors mis-diagnosed me with over the years and am so glad to finally have found out for myself what the problem was, and happily it is one that is easily fixed.  I do occassionally give in an have some hot chips (I'm only human!) but for that I can take some of the edge off the pain by taking a strong antihistamine.  ",5,3
 I had read that vulvodynia can be caused by a reaction to oxalates in food.,0,0
There is a whole thing about some scientists in a clinic recommending going on a low oxalate diet to cure vulvodynia. I forgot to write about that - that in the interests of going all out and doing everything I could to cure myself I also went on a low oxalate diet for a couple of years.,4.666666667,3
"Hi, just new to this , how on earth did you find such a helpful dermatologist, feel i am being fobbed off all the time , desperate.",3,2

" Just as I aged, my liver became less efficient at eliminating the toxin from the nutrient content, and the solanine built up in my system. ",4,3
"You have to remember that I'm no doctor, so I can only give my best guess on this.  But it seems to me that the toxins were deposited in the mucous membranes of my skin, causing the nerves to react.",4,3
I also developed bleeding gums and diffuse itch in the mouth whenever I eat too much of the Solanacea family.  But of course the vagina and vulvar have the most mucous membranes and I got the most pain there. ,4,3
" Urinating didn't bother me, so I don't think Solanine gets excreted in the urine.  It seems my liver does get around to de-toxifying over the course of several days but it deposits into the mucous membranes until the liver can manage it, rather than de-toxifying immediately as when I was younger.",4,3
" I used to be unable to sleep due to the pain, and forget having sex.  Happily, cutting out potatoes and tomatoes is a small price to pay for being able to to all that again. ",3.333333333,2
Continuous unrelenting pain is horrible. ,1.66,1
"I recently had a shoulder operation and straight afterward I was in the most excrutiating pain, but I knew it would pass and I felt appreciable better by the next day. But that vulva pain just carries on, day in day out, always there clawing at you. So glad to be rid of it.",5,3
I have never heard of the problem you had with solanine. I feel that someone should gather together everyone's successful vulvodynia stories on a website so that others can read our stories and discover what the cause is for them and find a cure.,4,3
"I'm battling vulvodynia as well, for many years. I am currently very confused to try which approach. ",5,3
" I wanted to try the low oxalate diet, just found out about it while googling, but my gp dismissed it, and any other holistic approach really. She prescribed amitriptylines and told me to try them for 4 weeks.",5,3
I have two recommendations (that I haven't seen in a lot of places) for anyone else who is suffering.,1.66,1
I have just started using Dermol 500 lotion. It feels a million times better than last week. It's too soon to say if it will cure it but I am hopeful. Look for a similar lotion / creams. They are called emulsifying ointments. ,5,3
"I too feel like there is something wrong internally with me, like an allergy of some sort. ",3.333333333,2
" I have inflammation on my eyes, my scalp and face also are very sensitive. Very similar feeling of soreness and irritation to vulvodynia.",4.333333333,3
"I hate to stop eating all the delicious cakes, breads, junk food and even the healthy tomatoes and stuff but I feel like a special diet can fix this.",1.333333333,1
" I feel like I either need to use Dermol 500 to feel okay, or find the right diet for myself. Again, shame it takes so long to find out what food you are intolerant to. GPs dismiss my diet related inquiries so it's hard to design a diet on my own.",5,3
"I have done a cleanse 3 months ago which didn't seem to help, and now I think it's because of the nightshades and some high oxalate greens I have been eating since then. ",4.333333333,3
"It is a shame your GP is unwilling to consider alternative therapies. Stick with the amitriptyline, it will help with pain and sleeping.",0,0
"I believe that it was the alternative therapies (acupuncture, manual desensitisation, etc) that actually cured me. I was surprised, after my experiences with gynaecologists, that my consultant dermatologist (who specialised in vulvar pain) recommended acupuncture, manual desensitisation, physiotherapy, chiropractic and psychosexual therapy to me, but I am so pleased she did. ",5,3
my GP said “your husband must be very patient” - as if men have sexual desires and needs that have to be met!,4.333333333,3
" If anything, my sexual desires are stronger than my hubby’s and he doesn’t give me enough!!! When he had pneumonia and had no strength for sex for a long time his GP didn’t say “your wife must be very patient”!!",1,0
I am sure that stress is a contributory factor - I was very stressed when I got the persistent and recurring thrush which turned into vulvodynia.,5,3
I think stress is the hardest to 'fix' of all. Deep breaths have been the best for me but they are so momentary.,3.333333333,2
I don't know if my problem can't be called vd if it is related to dermatology rather than nerve system. They are indeed very different and probably needs to be separated but so far just finding out the name vulvadynia has helped me find SO much information.,4.666666667,3
"I’m so happy to have found all you girl’s, I’ve been suffering of vulva pain itching and burning in the last 6 months, feeling very said and depress.",4.666666667,3

"I used diprobase cream. Like you say, there are a lot of such emolients and it is worth experimenting to find put what works for you. Mine personal favourite was coconut oil - I found that soothing but the oily stain can show through clothes, so panti pads are advised when out and about.",4,3
"Sitting definitely aggravates. However, for me exercise aggravated too. I had to give up all exercise and walked only when absolutely necessary. As I was recovering I walked longer and longer distances.",3.666666667,2
Im a very anxious person so please no negetives ha. I like you suki girl got this after an ongoing infection. Treated with about 6 rounds of antibiotics. ,5,3
I did have shooting pains sometime too. That is why is did the yoga postures for relieving trapped pelvic nerves. ,4.333333333,3
"Vulvodynia can be cured, I am proof of that.",5,3
" I asked my consultant dermatologist about the people who had had it for years and she said that these were the people that hadn’t bothered to do anything about it or gave up, because it does take a long time to cure and it is slow progress and it won’t go away on it’s own",5,3
"The amitriptyline helped reduce my pain and helped me sleep, but what really made a difference and sped up the recovery was the acupuncture. ",5,3
" Have you considered trying that? The dermatologist and acupuncturist told me that the amitriptyline and acupuncture work together well in damping down those overactive, hypersensitive nerves.",5,3
"For the shooting pains try the yoga positions for the pelvis. I just googled them but the position I used was to lay on my back on the floor, bring my knees up to my chest and, with my hands press my legs down onto my body.",3,2
It took me 2 years before I could say I was back to normal.,2,1

" I'm almost 62, haven't been able to have sex for at least half a year if not longer. ",3,2
 I hated sitting - any pressure on that area made the pain worse because the nerves are so hypersensitive. At work I used to fold one leg under me so I was sitting on my lower leg so so that my vulva area was not touching the seat. ,4,3
I got a numb leg! Your memory foam cushion is not a good idea.,2.666666667,1
I'm at my wits end again...at work..which I had to change careers because I couldn't sit because of this.  I want to cry.  My boyfriend wants to have sex and the thought at this moment makes me shutter...and I'm a very sexual person...so I'm just ticked off or sad at all times lately.,3,2
" I know how you feel. At one point when I was in so much burning that it was affecting my ability to function on a daily basis I seriously considered have that skin cut off. But, luckily I found the dermatologist who specialises in vulva pain.",5,3

"after dealing with vaginale irritation for 8 months and being treated for several different yeast infections, my doctor finally diagnosed with me vulvodynia and said I had muscle spasms (vaginismus) as a result. ",5,3
"I am 16/virgin, and this diagnosis really worried me. My doctor made me feel optmistic but from all these stories I read online, this seems to be something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life, and this worries me so much. ",5,3

"Try everything, like I did, and you will find something that works for you and will gradually make you better.",2,1
"I tend to get a bit annoyed at doctors when they diagnose vulvodynia.  When I've researched this, I can only conclude that vulvodynia is simply a catch-all phrase for doctors to say, ""I don't know"".

Part of the problem is the multiple different causes: infection; physical trauma; chemical trauma; allergies; stress; trapped pelvic nerves",5,3
 and it is hard to identify the cause especially when there can be multiple factors at play. I guess that is why my dermatologist told me to try everything.,5,3

Just wondering whether it is somehow related with Vulvodynia.,1.66,1
Does anybody have insights/info or similar experience where one feels anal pain besides vulvodynia?,1.66,1
"My vulvodynia also involved the perineum, so extended from the posterior of my vulva to my anus but not inside the anus itself. It sound like yours may not be due to trauma of the nerve endings but perhaps a problem with the nerves coming from the spine to that area",5,3

It was the best thing I ever did. Somtimes I get stinging or itching just inside vag opening. This can be from tight muscles in pelvic floor. Believe it or not the muscles can be so tight on the nerves,4,3

I'm also experiences some minor teeth pain on my lower left side due to a cavity that needs to be filled. my question is could the two be related? could my tooth pain be causing my other symptoms?,4,3
Yes it could be related. You could have an infection in your tooth and your lymph nodes could be swollen and that's why you are experiencing the pain in your breast area to your elbow. But to be safe I would have it checked out.,0,0
I highly doubt that the cavity in your mouth is causing axillary pain in your lymph nodes in your arm pit or the arm pain. The cervical lymph nodes would be the drainage point for your mouth.,0,0

I have a sister who passed away from breast cancer. She was diagnosed when she was 45. I have been getting digital a mammography every year but I wonder if an MRI would be better. My gyn doesn't recommend the MRI for me. Should I seek out another gyn doctor?,5,3
"go for breast ultrasound, yearly, it's way better then mammogram in detecting anything suspicious. MRI usually doctors don't recommend until and unless they are pretty sure of the disease",1.44,1
Is the ultrasound a step up from a digital mammogram? Two of my sisters had no problem getting their doctors to do a yearly breast MRI. All they did was say they had a sister that died from breast cancer.,1.333333333,1
"An Ultrasound is better for dense breasts, and to define cysts. The 3 -D digitally enhanced mammography has improved earlier diagnosis, and therefore treatment and prognosis dramatically.",0,0
i agree get genetics testing as if you do not have the BRCA gene for example then you are not of significantly increased risk of developing breast cancer.,0,0
in the UK if you are very young 30-40 and have an increased risk sometimes a mammogram is done every other year with an MRI inbetween to reduce radiation to the breasts.,1.66,1
"however digital mammography is the best way of detecting early stages of breast cancer and changes in the breast. ultrasound is usually good on larger lesions, denser breasts as it is better at determining structure of a lesion (etc cyst is fluid, fibroadenoma solid but benign and cancer looks different).",0,0
MRI is also not the best way of finding very small changes in the breast and can highlight sometimes completely benign things.,0,0
MRI is good at looking at the extent cancer has spread however the idea of regular mammography is to detect the cancer before this happens. ,0,0
 changes in the breast the size of a grain of sand can be picked up on mammography such as microcalcifications before they ever turn in to a lump you can feel. hope this helps,0,0

I am 32 years of age and situation has lasted over 4 months. It started when a female at a strip club slid her hands into my pants and rubbed / grabbed my erect penis near the urinary meatus (opening).,2.666666667,1

Lol at least not inside your pants maybe outside.",0,0
Sounds almost exactly like my experiencee except for the stripper grabbing - which may have just caused a little scratch that keeps getting irritated. I think mine started  with irritation from my swimsuit lining (kind of a scratch / irritated area) . Tested negative for all std. ,5,3
I was treated for a yeast infection by primary care physician  even tho they didn’t really test for it ( yeast infection  is rare in circimsised men). It probably wasn’t yeast  because it  didn’t really get  better until I started using  a really heavy duty moisturizer  (Okeeffes Working Hands ).,5,3
 Consulted a Urologist he said it was localized irritation.  Not sure what sets it off. It  could be the urine  dribble that takes awhile to stop after urinating.,5,3
 I try to wipe it dry after and dab vasoline right on the meateus after but if i get a drop and it sits in it in my underwear i think it causes irritation.  It could also be that i have a disposition to dermatitis and psoriasis. ,4.666666667,3
If  I have an irritated skin area in one place I will usually get a spot elsewhere.  I haven’t seen a dermatologist yet  because it mostly goes away.  Then returns every so often very slightly.   ,4,3
I believe the rash was due to urine leaking in my underwear.  I put vasoline in my glans and the rash is subsiding. ,4,3
"I have some swelling still but major pain is gone. Urologists tell me that I am okay but I still have post void dribble, which has not gotten better. Still dealing with this.",5,3

I have had the same issue for 7 weeks now. Were you able to figure out what was the cause and what solutions resolved your issue? Please help,0.666666667,0
Well the redness and some of the pain have gone away. But the swelling and urine dripping remains.,1.66,1
"I have seen many urologists and dermatologists now, but I do not have a diagnosis - beyond dermatitis which is  generic, meaning the doctors don't know what is going on. ",5,3
" It is not STD related because there was no intercourse (or oral contact). Apparently the only two major STD's that could possibly, but RARELY spread non-sexually would be Herpes and HPV.",1.66,1
This is not Herpes (no rash and I have tested) and likely not HPV either. I have been dealing with this for months now.... Its crazy man.,5,3
"The one thing that seemed to help me , i think , is to never ever let urine sit on it or even one drop in my shorts. Squeeze until it stops dripping. Wipe it. Then wipe it with a damp paper towel or toilet paper.  All my symptoms are gone. It may be urine centered irritation.  ",4,3
 I do at the very tip.  I have redness around the opening and pain but I’ve had a cystocopy and every test so not sure where the pain really is.  I have urine dribbling as well.,5,3
" I had these symptoms for a period of time but, they went away over time. I felt an urge, but urine would not come out initially and at times it would be post urination.",4,3
"Stream was ok though, according to my urologist. I have had 2 cysto's (fun stuff) - but like you nothing was found",5,3
"The doctors think my issue may be nerve related and therefore it was difficult to tell where the pain is. Pain can be referred, meaning that you can feeling it in an area, that is not causing the pain. ",5,3
"Have had this for a little more than 5 months now. Can relate to all 12 of your points (though the part of the meatus that is open for me is the top half). Tested negative for everything under the sun, did two weeks of doxy and month of cipro.",5,3
 Mine came about a few days after oral sex (w/ skin breakage on the glans due to a tooth nick) and condom break in the same week which obviously fuels my anxiety in terms of the possibility of infection. ,4,3
By far the worst part is rubbing on or touching any clothing. Seems like recently yours has been getting better. ,1.333333333,1
Honestly time seems to be the only thing helping. I was using different steroid creams and I firmly believe they were causing more/different issues. ,5,3
 I have been putting vasoline on my glans to protect it against my boxers and urine dribble and it seems to help. Some of the redness has also resolved.,4.666666667,3
"I have met with some  experienced doctors and they keep telling me that I am fine. It’s frustrating when I hear this, as they have all acknowledged my inflammation and symptoms. ",5,3
I am leaning towards nerve damage at this point. This is what one of the urologists suggested was wrong.  I took psych meds to help with the nerve issue and it did seem to take the pain away.  ,5,3
"I have been very thoroughly std tested, had 2 cystoscopy exams, had an ultrasound, and now even a semen culture and nothing had surfaced.",5,3

"I still have redness/discoloration on my glans as well, which also comes and goes. ",4,3
"I'm going to 2 different urologists on Wednesday.  This is going on 5 months for me and from what I've read, you and me have very similar issues.",5,3
" I keep taking pictures when my meatus is inflamed and area around the opening. It looks like my meatus is swollen, but it also feels that way on the inside along with pain.  ",4,3

I'm going to try betamethasone for a couple of weeks as well as taking ibuprofen everyday.  She said to put it inside my urethra and it is safe. ,5,3
He was at a loss and thinks it may be a dermatology issue so told me to go to dermatologist.  ,4,3
"I'm not gonna lie, I don't want to live everyday of my life in pain like this. I'm almost at a loss at this point.",4,3
" although I'm just a regular guy and not a doctor, to me your meatus looks irritated or inflamed. I've definitely still got my fair share of issues, especially urine dribbling, but the anti-inflammatories that I've been taking (Meloxicam and some supplements like Quercetin) are definitely helping with the pain. ",5,3
I'd try the cream and the ibuprofen. Try like 800 mg (400 mg probably isn't going to do anything). ,1.66,1
 he also recommended bee pollen - which apparently helps with inflammation in the body.,1.66,1
I had severe pain initially and one of the urologists assessed that I was dealing with neuropathic penile pain. It is possible that this can cause the inflammation.,5,3
"The doctor put me on a low dose neuro drug that did help resolve the pain - but I will tell you it also led to depression for me. But, once I came off the drug most of the major pain was gone. I still have symptoms, but I can make through the day now without throbbing pain. ",5,3
Have you noticed increased wrinkling on the glans or would you say it looks roughly the same other then the inflammation? Previously mine was very smooth but now has more of a wrinkled and red look (rather than smooth and pink). ,4,3
mine similarly started after a sexual encounter with a girl that I later learned had been sleeping around a fair bit before we met. ,1,0
It looks the same other than the inflammation. ,1.66,1
I just talked to the dermatogist and she do NOT use betamethasone on the genital area.  It’s amazing that the urologist told me it was fine to use that inside my urethra. ,5,3
I will be using desonide and then getting a scrape soon.  Going to primary care doctor tomorrow to make sure something else isn’t going on.,5,3
 my dermatologist indicated the same. He said that long-term use of corticosteroids such as Betamethasone can cause skin thinning in penile tissue.,5,3
Had read similar online but my urologist has suggested using steroid creams so I was honestly just trusting him (wasn’t going to use much though). ,5,3
"Also just wanted to note that with everything I’ve been taking/doing, I haven’t moved backwards in like two weeks and may have even had some continued improvement.",1.333333333,1
I went to my primary care Dr and he couldn’t see anything wrong. Still waiting on some bloodwork he sent off or different things.  He referred me to another dermatologist who I just got back from.,5,3
"when you met with the first dermatologist, what did he think could possibly show up in the ""scrape"" or biopsy? ",0,0
They would be able to see under a microscope the size of the cells and said they had many different ways to tell what it is. ,0.333333333,0
The problem with mine is that it’s very close to the opening so they’re afraid to mess something up.,1,0
"I wonder if my urine is too acidic all the time.  My urine ph test just yielded a 5, which is acidic.",5,3
" If I don’t urinate for a few hours and then go, it seems to be stuck at the opening and then sprays.   They didn’t see anything in my cystoscopy but it defintelt swells on the inside.   I hope the steroid/aleve can reduce the inflammation to help whatever it is heal.",5,3
Urine definitely makes everything worse.,1.66,1
Anti-inflammatories seem to help but don’t seem to solve anything long term (though the longer I’ve been taking the anti-inflammatories I seem to have less urethral pain and less dribbling). ,5,3
"Also I have urinary hesitancy that feels like it’s caught at the tip as well. Additionally, feels like I have dribbling because there’s urine that doesn’t make it past this spot. Cystoscopy showed nothing though.",5,3
I asked the nurse practioner about a urethrogram today and she said she didn’t think it would give us any new information.   Kind of irritated me. ,5,3
How long have you been taking the anti inflammatories and at what dose for the pain to go away?,0,0
My urologist gave me Meloxicam which is a prescription anti inflammatory often used for arthritis. It has a half life of over 20 hours so you don’t have to take every few hours like ibuprofen. I’ve also been taking quercetin twice a day.,5,3
"This has not entirely erased my pain, but it’s probably 70 or 80% better than my worst. And I seem to be still improving.  ",4,3
"I just started trying Urimar T.  It’s like Azo but has some extra things in it. It turns your urine radioactive blue.  So if I can reduce inflammation with that, thr Aleve, and the steroid cream, hopefully I can knock it out somehow.",5,3
  my GP got the bloodwork back and it showed elevated inflammation in my body.    He wants me to come in for further bloodwork so I’m going to the lab tomorrow.  ,5,3
 how did the Dr. determine that you had elevated inflammation? ,0,0
"No my white blood cell count looks normal, unfortunately, or the antibiotics would’ve knocked this out.",5,3
"This was a CRP - C reactive protein test.  Apparently it is a marker in the blood that rises in response to inflammation.  It doesn’t specify where in the body the inflammation is though, and could mean a variety of things.",1.66,1
It is almost like urine gets stuck in the tip of the urethra.,1.44,1
I also feel a tickle or tingle sensation in the head of the penis that comes and goes. The entire glans is sensitive to touch.,4,3
"I have been having the same issue for the past 3 months. I took an STD test 3 months after exposure and it come out negative. But I still need to get tested for Trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis is not in the std screening.",5,3
"I have the exact same issue, Ive been tested for all STD's except for HSV-1 and HSV-2 as I havnt had any sores or puss or anything like that and they dont generally test for that in the UK unless you have those blisters.",5,3
Ive been with my partner for a year and a half and we both go tested back in Jan 2018 for everything so I know we are both clean.,5,3
Glad to hear im not the only one suffering here! Im wondering if depression or anxiety doesnt make the issue worse?,3.333333333,2
Has anyone experienced any lower back pain or pain on the sides? ,1.66,1
"I have had itching in my anus area and my balls too, but that seems to have been sorted after using Daktacort and has subsided alot, I have also ordered something off Amazon called ""Chassis Premiun body powder for men"" as I do sweat and get trapped moisture down there so Im just trying to eliminate different things really.",5,3
Also today ive switched to 100% cotton breathable underwear to see if this helps as heat and moisture is a breeding ground for bacteria or any other nasties.,1.886666667,1
"I had your symptoms for about a decade or more, nobody could tell why. ",2.666666667,1
 the redness was gone and the next day it looked like never had problem. I did this twice a day and in a few days my painful urination improved a lot.,4,3
"My issue is still no better so latest cream, Trimovate, has made no noticeable difference sadly. Assuming fungal as pass all tests but is currently quite sore/painful.",5,3
i had a sebaceous gland irritation on the foreskin and also what i assumed a fungal infection that was undiagnosed and not responding to antifungal creams.,5,3
So I underwent surgery on 18th Dec. 2019 on my dominant right hand. This was 4 weeks after I had my left hand done. ,5,3
"Left hand went very well, so I had no worries about getting my right hand done. I had read up on everything I could find relating to the surgery, leading up to the first hand being done, and I found very little to suggest that things could go badly or lead to a poor outcome following surgery.",5,3
"My concern here is that I don't want to put anyone off getting the surgery done, as its worked well for my left hand, but I feel people should be aware of the rare occasion when things don't turn out the way you would hope they would.",5,3
"On the day of my right hand being done, everything went pretty much the same way as it did the day of the left hand surgery. ",5,3
"The only thing I can remember being different was the anaesthetic as it took over my lungs, slight panicky feeling then I was out.",4.666666667,3
Don't remember that from the first surgery. Following surgery my hand felt a bit more sore than the left hand did but I didn't take much notice at the time. ,5,3
So I was expecting the numbness in my hand from the drugs to wear off after 24hrs as it had done before.,5,3
This time though it took an extra 24hrs for the numbness to start to wear off. ,1.66,1
It was at this point I felt that something was different. Half of my middle finger and half of my ring finger and the webspace between them remained numb. ,3.666666667,2
Every morning after that I woke hoping that today the numbness would go but it didn't.,3.333333333,2
"Then another symptom started to appear, I would get excrutiating pain in the tips of both of those fingers like they were being squeezed in a vice.",4,3
I also had a lot of swelling in my entire hand. I put up with this for a few days until the worst pain to date woke me up at night on the 24th December. ,4,3
"I contacted the surgeon that day through my doctor, the surgeon relayed through my doctor, that pain and swelling were normal at this stage and they would see me on 3rd Jan.",5,3
"So that date came around, I saw the surgeon who said he didn't realise the level of pain that I had been in.",5,3
 He said to give it six weeks and see where its at then. No offer of pain meds at anytime since the surgery.,1.66,1
" So six weeks went by, all the time the numbness and swelling remained, along with the intermittent vice feeling on the two finger tips.",2,1
When I met the surgeon again he said he didn't know what was going on and had never seen this in all the hands he has worked on before. ,4.666666667,3
He still felt though that this could wear off. He said he would arrange a nerve conduction study to see what that would show. ,1.66,1
"That was scheduled for March 26th, but has been put on hold due to Covid-19.",0.333333333,0
"So that brings me to today, as I type this I still have total numbness in half of the middle and ring finger. ",4,3
 I cannot make a fist as it feels like I am holding a small object in my hand which is preventing my hand from closing. ,3,2
I am still experiencing the vice feeling in the finger tips but not as painful as it was. ,4,3
 When I stretch my hand the two fingers feel very restricted and I get a burning sensation in them. ,4,3
If I run a finger across my palm I get an electric shock feeling running up into both fingers.,4,3
If I tap on my wrist the electric shock feeling goes right through the centre of my hand and up into the two fingers.,4,3
So I wait for a revised date on the nerve study and don't know if there is a resolution to this.,1.773333333,1
I do my best to use the hand as much as possible as I don't want the muscles wasting away. I'm lucky that my job entails working on a pc. ,1,0
"If I had a very manual job, I would not have been able to return to work yet.",0,0

"If it happened to me though, can it happen to you as well? or am I the very rare case that goes wrong?",1,0
"Either way, everyone should have access to all sides of the story, not just the good outcomes, as I enjoy with my left hand, but the, ""I don't believe that this has happened to me"" outcome, as I continually endure with my right hand.",2,1

"Its quite a few years now since my surgery, and I still return to this site to write and warn others that the outcomes are not always favourable. ",5,3
"The electric shock you refer to is due to the tendon now being exposed, and is very sensitive.",0,0
" I had that for about 6-9 months, but doing something like lifting a heavy object or digging with a spade gave me the same reaction for over a year.",2.333333333,1
"The experience you are having though is different from mine, and seems more like trigger finger, I'm not a doctor but my mother suffered with similar issues until her trigger finger release.",2,1
I have pain across the back of my hands and my finger joints ache a lot still.,4,3
I cant remember the date of my surgery off hand but its about 7-8 years now.,5,3
"A lot of the immediate issues dissipate, an inability to open a wide rimmed jar though that's never going away.",1,0

"It adds to the bigger picture to hear others experiences, even if they are not necessarily what you would like to hear pre-surgery.",1.66,1
I agree sometimes the outcomes are worse than the problem.,0.333333333,0
 I still think that what they do is quite barbaric really.,0,0
"There are two major ligaments of the hand the palm which create the carpal tunnel and the dorsal on the back of the hand, they balance each other out. ",0,0
 Holding the fingers in place they create support and balance between both sides. ,0,0
 When you remove one you ask a lot more of the individual ligaments on the fingers and release the tension on the dorsal ligament on the back of the hand.,0,0
 mine has created a lot more work for the muscles between my fingers on the back of my hand.,1.666666667,1
Strangely if I fall asleep on my hand only my 4th and 5th finger go to sleep.,3,2
 I wish surgeons explained more about the potential negative impact.,1.66,1
More and more will suffer in the future as typing and using a mouse are both causes for it.,0,0

"i have a right cervical rib quite high up, since February of this year i have been unable to sleep on a pillow turn my neck completely to the right without feeling an extreme tight neck jammed feeling,",4,3
before finding out i had this rib i had neck adjustments at the chiropractor along with working as a cleaner for 2 years wearing a very heavy vacuum that pulled my shoulders forward believing this somehow exposed the rib,5,3
when i turn my neck it feels as if the muscle attach to my skull is chronically tight. ,4,3
coming up to a year with no relief and constant deep tissue massages also quitting work 10 months ago now still no change,2.666666667,1

"however i don't suffer with the numbness or lack of circulation like most obvious symptoms, no migraines ect and i sleep ok other than can't use a pillow at all.",4,3
my MRI did mention i have minor straightening of the upper cervical lordosis bascially straight neck. could this issue cause the neck jammed feeling ?,5,3
I have cervical ribs. I also had a prolapsed cervical disc which was replaced 9 years ago. ,5,3
" I suffer from a tingling in my right arm, a heavy arm, numb hands and my right hand turns blue if I let it lie to the side of me if I am sitting - very strange. ",4.333333333,3

These have really helped me. My neck does not feel as bad as it used to. ,2.666666667,1
In a really high dose they are anti depressants but in a low dose (up to 5 tablets) they are used to relax the nerves and muscles.,0,0

doctor just told me to get antihistamines im 18 days of mirt noe and 12 days on Citalopram im taking nightall to sleep just woried my sleep wont come back iwas on mirt for 3mths 30 then 2 weeks on 15 then he put me o 10 mls Citalopram now been on them 12 days thank you for your reply,5,3
I'm wondering whether you should reinstate Mirt at a low dose e.g. 7.5mg and then taper very slowly.,0,0
If the doctor wants you to use antihistamines then he/she should prescribe them and not expect you to source them yourself. (the sedative effect of Mirt is due to it being a powerful histamine blocker),0,0
my doctor dosnt seen interested he told me through his secretary to get some carmers the pharmacist said theyre no good and gave me nightall tried it last night got 5 hrs not natural sleep but better than none,5,3
"I know it's hard, but could you see a different doctor?",0,0
"I assume it's Nytol you've got? If so then it's an antihistamine hence the sedation, if it's any consolation it's the antihistamine activity of Mirtazapine that causes sleep, it's just that Mirt is a very, very strong histamine blocker.",0,0
Nytol also do a 'herbal' one - it's just Valerian root the same as Kalms and H&B.,0,0
Hi Charlieive asked the pharmacist about valerian he says stick with nytol just short term as they can be adictive started with diarea all day yesterday and still todsy is that another side afect wish the side afecs would supside and i can feel normal again 3weeks off mirt tommorow and 2 weeks on cit counting the days thanks for answering me helps me to understand a bit more,5,3

it took a month from starting Citalopram for my sleep to improve slightly. The rebound insomnia from Mirtazapine withdrawal took several months.,5,3
the doctor has sugested i reenstate mirt in 2 weeks at 15 mls when ive been on cit for a month for sleeping im not happy at that i i thought id gotten off mirt looks like i dont have a choice other than sleeping pills scared to go back on it,5,3
"I think the new doc might be right, reinstate Mirt on a low dose for a while then taper off very, very, very slowly.",0,0
If you do go back on see if 7.5mg is enough - it is usually more sedating at lower doses so this might be enough to get you some sleep.,0,0

I'm in my late 40s and have been taking Mirtazaine for 3 years. In the last year I've had itches in my legs and burning feet.,5,3
I came off the Mirt in mid November and have been exeriencing worse symptoms of peripheral neuropathy - itchy burning feet and pins and needles in my hands (mainly at night).,5,3
I doubt it. I do get restless legs for about 10 minutes or so shortly after taking my dose. But then it quickly settles down.,4.666666667,3
Mirtazapine has actually stopped all my itching that I used to have daily before taking the drug.,5,3
i am not so sure to dismiss this so easily as I have been on mirtazapine for four years and two years ago developed numb feet. Just cannot get to the bottom of this at all after many trips to docs and hospital to find out.,5,3
 I am having trouble coming off due to lack of sleep. ,3,2
No it's not vitamin B - I've had all the other checks so it's not clear what the cause is.,3,2
 I have to say the symptoms were mild (slightly itchy and burning feet - worse if I had a drink) whilst I was on the Mirtazapine and got worse 6-8 weeks after I came off it completely (so it was obviously masking some of the symptoms). ,5,3
"I did see a study that showed a handful of people (out of 17,000) had reported neuropathy - all had been on Mirt for 2-5 years, all were over 40.",0,0

The ER prescribed hydroxyzine pamoate for the dizziness and anxiety but all that did was knock me out and feel extra groggy when I woke up. I saw my doctor again yesterday who prescribed Ativan for the anxiety which does help get rid of these symptoms but obviously it's not something I can take all the time.,5,3
"Everything I've read indicates that Lisinopril is out of your system in a few days and the effects of it are gone in 1 - 2 weeks. I'm wondering if that's accurate since I'm still experiencing these symptoms, although to a slightly lesser degree, after 3 weeks.",5,3

I got tested for Lyme disease too to rule that out.,5,3

Has anyone gained weight from antihistamines and xolair shots..,0.333333333,0
"I have awful joint pain, hair loss, and a rapid weight gain.. like 7 lbs in two weeks..  But the hives are a lot less but at what cost with all these drugs.. any one out there experience this?? What did you do ??",5,3
You need to tell your doctor immediately about your side effects. Joint pain is the only listed side effect for xolair that you are experiencing.,0,0
 I did not experience any side effects (other than it stopped working to control my hives after a couple months) with xolair. Everyone is different.,4,3
Your side effects don’t seem “normal” for just that one medication. Rapid weight gain can be associated with steroid use. Are you taking steroids as well?,0,0
I will talk to the dr.. I have an appt dec 29 for another shot so will be speaking to the rn.. then appt with allergist on jan 10.. ,5,3
I am not taking steriods unless i start to swell with angioedema in my face but that hasnt happened for a couple months..  i am trying to hang in but it is really tough as you know,4,3
I have gone back to trying to be gluten free again.. it seemed i didnt itch or have as many hives then.,3.666666667,2
the allergist before this one told me i am not allergic to any food or i wouldnt die if i got anaphyaltic (SP)?? shock that i went back to eating gluten.. ,5,3
 have not felt well since i did that.. and i got rid of him.. but i will look into what you did and the cost of doing that.. ,1,0
 I will take my next xolair shot and plan out what i need to do to be hive free to take the tests if i can.. and yes it really does affect your life and i cant stand all these drugs,5,3
I've been insisting for 5-years that food is a major factor. It can't be co-incidence that so many many people on here point at food.,0,0
"With me, the worst foods are Gluten and Milk-based. Alcohol and caffeine aren't helpful either, especially if I overdo it and even more so if it's more than one day in a row.",1.333333333,1
"High-protein and vegetable and good oil-based diets with low-carb and low-sugar intake make my health generally better. Painkillers are bad news, especially ibuprofen, Salicylates generally possibly too. Sulphites and Benzoates trigger hives and Asthma.",3,2
I will be getting my fourth shot the 29 of dec.. I was going to skip it but decided not to as the aches and pains just went away so maybe it is a side effect that does go away.. ,5,3
 The hair loss and weight gain can also be from the many antihistamines i was taking and hydrodrozine causes hair loss and weight gain I just found out.. ,5,3
i will start going gluten free again and test that out. I just kinda have a feeling gluten may be my problem or at least part of it..,3,2
But it has been so wonderful to be hive free that I decided to take another shot then speak to my allergist ..,5,3
. Just when i think maybe i have this all figured out I realize i dont..  I need to be hive free for three weeks with no meds either to see if can take a few allergy tests..,4.333333333,3
"I feel so bad for all of us that have these , and what works for one person wont work for the other...",1,0
I think the weight gain is way more likely to be the hydrozyzine. A lot of those types of drugs made me pile on weight.,4.666666667,3
the joint pain could easily be from weight gain too. I got ITB injuries in both my knees after being on Doxepin and gaining two stone rapidly.,5,3
"My muscles /joints weren't used to the extra weight, and I kept running and was struggling with a new baby and carrying them around.",2,1
"Same with me and the gluten and/or milk. Pizza, lasagne and beer over Christmas and the hives came raging back. Alcohol is bad news for me and my hives. Had some really angry ones on my upper hips yesterday, looked like burn blisters they were so big and angry.",3.666666667,2
I think i will cut down on the hydroxyzine.. it sure does work for itching but i just got my forth xolair shot yesterday so hoping i can cut down on all this soon and working on a gluten free diet again..,5,3
I hate the hives on my face as they usually end up being angioedema and i am in the er unless i take 20 mg of prednisone right away when i feel them..,5,3
my lip was swollen up yesterday before my xolair shot but went down afterwards..yes i am sure the sore are from the weight gain as when i pick up the amt of weight,5,3
  I'm curious if you are taking just one injection a month or two of Xolair? ,0,0
I am getting two shots a month 300 mg total.. I will be going to my allergist the 10 of jan and i am going to ask her about all this..,5,3
I did meet a woman yesterday who is taking these shots as well and she has had no side effects so i really dont know if i am or it is all the other antihistamines and stuff i am still taking ..,5,3
"I, like most people tested for everything. I developed dermographism and then hives.",5,3
Coming up on a year I am on my 4th Xolair shot. I can honestly say it has changed my life.,5,3
I was also taking hydroxyzine ... my arm in the shot area is extremely sore and my legs arms fingers are all in pain. ,5,3
 My hands are so sore and tingle every morning. Most days I can’t bend them. Reading these forums make me feel like I have an answer.,3.666666667,2
The mental anguish I felt from the hives ..... I don’t think can be compared..... I would recommend Xolair to anyone especially with the $5.00 copay. ,4,3
I have recently been experimenting with my other medications.,5,3
 I was still taking 2 Doxepins (25mg ea) every night for sleep and to keep the hives at bay during the night hours. ,5,3
 I have gradually stopped that medication and my muscle/hands/legs/feet pain have greatly diminished. ,4.666666667,3
" I am taking very few antihistamines either.  I guess I will continue with the Xolair shots for 2 more months and at the 6 month point, my doctor wants to check me to see if I am finally rid of the hives.",5,3
"The weight gain is tough for me, but I am coping and considering 2017 also included my husband having a brain tumor and major surgery for that, weight gain is not my greatest concern.",2.666666667,1
I was just thinking this morning that my shot is on Monday and which is the lesser of two evils. For since Monday the hives are rearing their ugly heads and my lip has been swollen overnight for two days..,4.333333333,3
  I can tell the difference if I do not take the cetrizine.  But have completely stopped the hydroxyzine..... Terrible med..... ,5,3
But for almost a whole month the hives are gone and that is better all around for my mind and body.,3.666666667,2
"My consultant told me that a good percentage of people can actually go into remission after a number of Xolair shots (6-8). So even if the weight gain is related to Xolair (I think Hydroxyzine is more likely), temporary weight gain has to be balanced against the possibility of remission. ",4.666666667,3
"I might be trying Xolair next year, so will post on whether joint and weight gain is a problem for me.",4.333333333,3
I have tried to cut way down on the hydroxyzine and only take it now when i am so itchy nothing else helps..,5,3
I have been doing my gluten free diet again and the itching has subsided as well as the hives but i am taking xolair shots so maybe they are kicking in more than i thought.. ,4.666666667,3
hydroxyzine and other sedating antihistamines like it can affect your appetite but also disrupt high quality sleep and make you groggy which makes you less likely to move around. ,1.66,1
" It can feel like you sleep better, but it is sedation rather than good REM and NREM sleep which is what your brain and body needs to recover and to sort itself out, regulate your appetite etc...",0,0
Agreed the hydroxyzine I do not like at all.  I too think that the weight gain is secondary to taking the shot.  Let's get through this!!!,3,2
You all have been so helpful to me.. I am grateful we have this site to talk about all this and that i am not alone...,0.666666667,0
I only have the hives on my face and they can appear in no time and I usually take prednisone and hydroxizine to calm it down.,5,3
My face feels like it’s on fire and people tell me I look like my head is about to explode. Very annoying. ,3,2
 I have had 6 shots and my hives are nothing like they were .. I will be having my 7th in two days.. ,5,3
I do however have a few small hives here and there and i do get crazy itching.. I am now trying to be off all antihistamines however i did take benedryl tonight to see if i have any hives tomorrow,5,3
I’m so happy to have come across this thread. I’ve been dealing with UIC and dermatographism for close 12 years,5,3
I’ve done all different combos of antihistamines and tests. Like another user above I turned to the holistic approach which did the food sensitivity testing and I had several things come back that are listed as severe...,5,3
"For the past 4 months I’ve been cutting out many of the foods on my list and do feel better, Although I’m still having daily outbreaks. ",2.333333333,1
My new allergist suggested Xolair which I’m going to start soon but until it’s approved he prescribed Doxepin on top of the Zyrtec and hydroxyzine. I’ve gained 10lbs in 6 weeks and just realized it has to be from the medication. I’m only 35 so I’m really hoping Xolair works!,5,3
My doctor applied for assistance directly from the pharmaceutical company to provide samples free of charge.  In exchange I may be asked to update my condition from time to time.  ,5,3
The only thing that I pay for is my monthly charge to receive the injections from my doctor.  I too have gone the holistic route and high doses of very expensive supplements.,5,3
"Couldn't tell that it make much difference and frankly, when I feel stressed and/or are broken out, the last thing I want to do is give up the comfort food that make me feel better like chocolate!  Good luck...it's a journey, but we are all in this together! ",2,1
I have tried cutting out food and nothing seemed to help much except gluten free seemed to calm down the itching.,3.333333333,2
" I cant have any allergy testing until i am hive free without meds for 6 weeks.. not sure when that will happen ,I am fortunate my insurance pays for my xolair shots completely..",5,3
But I know they do have programs to help if ins doesnt pay.. and yes i gained weight like that but my allergist said it is the antihistamines and not the xolair ..,5,3
I am trying to be off all antihistamines now so we shall see.. But when i am stressed I find myself stress eating .. but that would not account for this weight gain...,5,3
The xolair works for me I will be having my 7th shot but I do have joint pain and not sure if the shot is causing this also..,5,3
"when i say it works for me I mean I am only getting a few hives and they small but they do itch but they come and go , no rhymn or reason ..",3.666666667,2
" I am currently taking the highest dose possible of antihistamine and the doctors have introduced an extra tablet called ""montelukast"".",5,3
"This seems to be helping but my concern is that i haven't been able to decrease my dosage at all without the hives reappearing. I have just started noticing an increase in drowsiness, weight gain, hair thinning and loss and have also started to get really bad headaches which I am not usually prone to.",4.333333333,3
The doctors have spoken to me about the Xolair injection that i am only able to qualify for if all other methods fail.,5,3
I am not keen to be taking any of it to be honest but feel like I have no control and no choice. These hives are taking over my life.,4,3
I too tried everything and have been taking xolair for over 2 years.. I still do get itchy occassionally but no breakouts and sometimes i think it is gluten and sugar as when i cut that out I seem to be itch free.. ,5,3
When i first started to take xolair my joints hurt like crazy and it was hard to get going when i would get up to walk.. ,5,3
I also gained weight and lost some hair.. The painful joints are gone and my hair has grown back a bit but the weight is difficult to come off but then again i take thyroid meds for my thyroid and these symtoms could be partly due to those pills.. ,5,3
 the only way to determine the headaches is start to eliminate some of the drugs.. I have had to do that with some of my pills infact a thyroid drug gave me the worse occular migraines.,5,3
I know for a fact antihistamines cause weight gain as well .. but with all the side effects of xolair I m not willing to give it up as i could not function with the daily horrible hives...,5,3
"I am in South Africa but totally understand - I also haven't met anyone with this terrible condition and not many understand what we go through i.e the unbearable itch, the scratching and hyperpigmentation, the debilitating effects of these hives and the change in quality of life!",4,3
"I was taking quadrupled dosages of antihistamines along with 10mg montelukast, but now have included cimetidine to it and for the last week appear to have only one or two baby hives with minimal itch.",5,3
How did you attempt to decrease the dosages of your antihistamines? was it just trial and error? i would like to try this weekend (too afraid to try during the week due to work ).,4.666666667,3
I feel for you having such limited resources there..fortunately our public health care system covers all specialist visits and the xolair injection now that I have been approved for that.,4,3
The reason i am moving onto this next phase of xolair is due to the fact that I am still taking a quadruple dose of antihistamine also and haven't been able to successfully decrease my meds at all without breaking out again. ,4,3
" I did try a couple of times but as soon as my breakouts came back a little more, i would go straight back on the full dose as I was so afraid it would come back completely.",3,2
"I have now been on the full dose since early September and along with the montelukast, I have been able to ""manage"" my hives however it definitely hasn't resolved the problem - just kept them at bay.",5,3
"I discussed with my doctor, this is not the way I want to live my life and we decided the injection would be the last resort. Just waiting on my script to arrive and then i can get started.",5,3
just make sure you take yourself off gradually to give your body time to adapt. It is such a high dose to be reliant on you don't want to shock your body. I made this mistake the first time I went off them and they came back with full force!,3,2
Really glad that your public health care system covers it. I have private medical aid/insurance here in South Africa and Xolair is still not covered by it (each injection is super expensive- R10000).,3,2
"Unfortunately, in South Africa there is no financial assistance for the Xolair as well as the Allergist firstly has to determine if it is severe enough to warrant Xolair and we then have to pay cash for the injections.",2,1
"Glad that you were able to ""manage"" your hives with your high dosages as some people sadly are unable to do so with antihistamines- I was only able to manage it for the last week after adding cimetidine to my high dosages and cocktail of pills but I am so grateful.",5,3
"Thankfully, it is the first week of relief after trying so many different types of antihistamines and I am hoping I can continue managing it until the hives disappear altogether ( i had read that The main focus of treatment is trying to alleviate symptoms while the urticaria slowly “burns” itself out and eventually clears – a process that may take many months or even some year- different for everyone!)",5,3
 will continue with my high dosages of antihistamines and slowly try to eliminate montelukast and then slowly drop dosages of antihistamines as well (just wish there was more info on how to wean ourselves off) I am hoping and praying that mine will go away soon as well. I have read that chronic urticaria lasts 1 -5 years and sometimes longer (praying that we will all be hive-free soon though).,5,3
I'm in the same position as you are right now without the montelukast.... Doctor keeps increasing my dose with the antihistamine... next step will be Xolair...,5,3
 however I was worried abut the cost and now reading all the comments I know I can receive financial aid...,0,0
"Ive had 2 injections so far. Straight after my first injection, I actually had more wheels than usual then they all disappeared after a few weeks. Now only have a few left but I have still been instructed to stay on the max dose of antihistamine and montelukast.",5,3
I am only able to decrease that dosage once ive been completely free from any sign of the hives for at least one full week.,4.333333333,3
I would advise trying the montelukast tab...i got amazing results almost immediately from those tablets added to my full dose of antihistamines. They just never completely went away so it was holding mine at bay but not curing me.,5,3

went to gp who said it was urticaria and to take some antihistamines and it would clear it.,5,3

i was referred to immunologist who just told me rather frustratingly that it appeared to be idiopathic as it was appearing everyday and just to take antihistamines and to re refer if the antihistamines didnt work.,5,3
sure enough i was re reffered and have started on the xolair but it made no difference although its been only two weeks but i have read people received instant relief. has anyone found ot took a delayed response for them to work?,5,3
i am taking antihistamines every two hours and am currently on my 9th steroid tablet to reduce the urticaria but nothing is workingn.,5,3
youre right but im just trying to find out why its started as thats terrifying too but the immunologist told me it was pointless and i wouldnt find a cause.,4.666666667,3
another dr told me that it would have to be a few different things together to align.,3,2
I am suffering from severe urticaria with angioedima . earlier i was also struggling same like you everyday.,5,3
This really helped me when the hives would get really bad and itchy.. I soak for 40 mins in a warm to hot bath with 2 cups of epsom salts.. I watch the hives slowly get pale and go away..,3.666666667,2
Now these are not cures but only ways to get thru the awful itch..,1.66,1
the Drs added  magnesium vitamin D and vitamin C to my regiment ! I have not tried the Epson salt bath because if I meant warm water for too long I get hives so I just take quick cool showers,5,3
that is exactly what happened to me a hot shower and i had a bad breakout. But i tried the epsom salts with a bad breakout and i was shocked the hives went away ,3.666666667,2

I’m on 150mg lamotragine p/day,5,3
50mg risperidone p/2 weeks injection,1.66,1
Due to side effects of lamotragine I’m thinking of asking my nurse if I can come off it. I’ve been on it for around 4 years on diff doses. ,5,3
I know I could switch mood stabilisers but I keep looking at side effects and they put me off. ,5,3
Is anyone successful in staying stable when on an antipsychotic alone??? Can it be done or will I fall into depression without a mood stabiliser ??? ,4.666666667,3
"Hi Karen, from my experience I'd say no because I think the anti psychotic is what controls mania and a mood stabilizer is still needed to keep you stable and control the highs and lows. I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features (my manic episodes can turn into full blown paranoia, hallucinations, etc.",5,3
"I take a mood stabilizer, and an anti psychotic and I'd honestly never try going without a mood stabilizer again.",5,3
"in my younger days when I was first diagnosed, I stopped my meds many times and ended up right in the hospital",5,3
"As we all know everyone is different, but I recently started lithium after trying every other med out there for the last 20 years and it was a rough start with side effects but after 6 weeks now, I feel the best I ever have.",5,3
"I was always afraid to try lithium, but there's a reason why it's been used for over 50 years and it's been a wonder drug for a lot of people with bipolar disorder. ",2.666666667,1
I take that and vraylar and I'm thinking I've finally found the right meds after many ups and downs!,5,3
"Keep in mind..you might be stable now. But what goes up always comes down for us with Bipolar. Whether it's in a few weeks or months, you're risking it without being on a mood stabilizer.",1.66,1
"Changing meds sucks and I can totally relate, I've spent the last 9 months switching from one to the next trying to find what works again. It's pure hell 😫 but I stuck it out somehow.",5,3
"Hi, thanks for the response. Did the side effects of lithium go away after 6 weeks then? ",0,0
I’m not stopping anything without my nurses consent but spoke to him before and he said depakote and lithium are my two other options.,5,3
He also said that I need to be on a mood stabiliser.,4,3
I’ve always been terrified of lithium myself because of the side effects but I’m thinking of giving it a go after talking it over with my mum and my nurse ,5,3
"Yes, the side effects actually weren't that horrible with the lithium.",1.66,1
"I was so worried about trying it too and about the side effects and it being high maintenance with making sure the levels are in the right range with labwork, but it was only a few weeks of side effects that were still tolerable, a couple trips to the lab and now I guess I only go every few months to the lab.",5,3
The side effects I had were mainly dizziness and nausea but it got better each week and now I dont notice any side effects.,4,3
"I'm dumb for looking up med reviews online because that's the worst thing you can do, everyone has a horror story, but everyone is so different. ",1.666666667,1
And lithium is so well known and my new Dr (50yrs of experience) said there's a reason why it's been prescribed for over 50 years..it works!,5,3
"I also weaned off lamictal (no issues, just didn't need 2 mood stabilizers) and I'm still weaning off trileptal and replacing it with the lithium so it's been a long transition but I'm honestly feeling great lately, and my husband and kids notice so it's been much better in our household lately",5,3
I'd definitely give lithium a try. I've been on depakote and it caused major weight gain which has always been a struggle for me so I chose to try the lithium. It still has weight gain as a side effect but I think it's less likely than the depakote.,5,3
That’s good to know about the weight gain thing! As a recovered anorexic I still worry about weight gain to the extremes of some medications. ,5,3
Thinking of definitely giving it a try now anyway. And I was definitely scared of lithium mostly because of what I’ve read about it online.,4.333333333,3
"I also had to stop taking lamotrigine because of the side effects, severe eye irritation/conjunctivitis for nearly 18 months - no medic made the connection, visited eye hospital twice and they said it was blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids) and I had to clean them twice a day with solution of baby shampoo and cotton buds!

It was me who made the connection after reading the patient info leaflet - within weeks of stopping lamotrigine my eyed cleared up.,5,3
Anyway back to you. Sort of.,0,0
I take quetiapine as a mood stabilizer even though it is officially an antipsychotic. Quetiapine is known to also have antidepressant properties and is sometimes used as an antidepressant as an add on treatment in bipolar depression.,5,3
"As my bipolar mostly takes the form of depression it wasn't enough on its own for me and I also take venlafaxine to guard against severe episodes which it has, although it hasn't prevented the mild more recurrent low moods.",5,3
"If you do decide to give quetiapine a go, be wary of taking too high a dose as it can leave you feeling flat and can't be bothered with things.",1.66,1
I found the therapeutic dose for me was 150 - 200mg.,5,3

I am a Counsellor/Psychotherapist and am ware of how important mental well being is. Talking about your condition and sharing your experiences I feel is the biggest energy boost - to be heard and validated that you are NOT being a miserable mare or a moody person who has lost their focus and way - I felt was really helpful.,1.773333333,1
It is so hard for my friends and family to understand me and my general doctor. ,5,3
Over the 7 years I have still been in and out of the doctors surgery with my energy levels and I really do think that there is something else lurking underneath - I can't quite understand why I should feel so awful a lot of the time.,5,3
Recently I have had many more symptoms which are now being heard by another stand-in Endocrinologist whilst all this Covid-19 goes on.,5,3
She actually called me yesterday to answer an email I sent to my usual endocrinologist who is off ill presently. She was fantastic and has arranged for me to go into hospital to have a blood test which she is getting tested for a whole load of deficiencies.

I was wondering if anyone has experienced hair loss from CRPS? I was diagnosed over a year ago after being injured at work. It was initially my back/rib/torso area but has spreaded to my shoulder/arm/wrist/hand/lower leg and foot. ,5,3
About 4 months ago I noticed my hair begin to become very rough and shed a lot and about a month ago it begin to come out in clumps! I cut my hair off because I couldn't stand to just watch my hair come out. As of today its still coming out as I rub my hands through it 😢😢,4,3
I now have a SCS which my PM doctor says should stop the spread. The SCS is actually working well (despite my skepticism). ,5,3
"My pain levels are down with the help of meds. I also can tell the difference when I don't take the meds with it( I'm desperately wanting to kick the opioids, hate the feeling). I'm slowly adjusting to the idea of the new life that I have been given.",5,3

I went a year without any invasive treatment. I've read that after about 6 months and no treatments you're pretty much doomed! I have high hopes and I'm determined not to continue let this beat me.,4,3
SCS is for Spinal Cord Stimulator. Its a device that's implanted to help with pain. It sends stimulating signals through the nerves to help block the pain signals to the brain. So far so good.,1.66,1
"Only downside is that it doesn't help with the symptoms much. I have both temperature changes ( my torso,back, arm is always burning and sweating while my lower leg is always freezing cold and shaking).",4,3
I'm sorry your son is battling this demon! I too am fairly young 34.,2,1
"I know what you mean, when your young it's aweful, and my son is now 16, He had a birthday back in July and he's been battling with the decision on whether he even wants to try driving, He said if something happened and he were to hit somebody else and they died, he said he didn't know if he could live with it.",0,0

I was curious about your SCS. I've just (3weeks ago) had mine implanted for my leg and am having my second one for my arm inserted next week. ,5,3
How long have you had them? I'm still having trouble with deciding how much it's working and it being quite positional. ,2,1
" I also developed a 'seroma', a pocket of serous fluid built up after surgery at laminectomy site and have a ball like a baseball there which they said could take weeks to months to settle down. ",5,3
It's just mildly uncomfortable.. Do you have different programs on SCS for different positions? I'm relieved to hear you're getting some relief from it as i was skeptical too even after a good trial.,4,3
"My surgeon said 30%just fail after insertion ,even with a good trial, so I'm worried about that and hoping I get good results (sorry ,apparently the seroma is impeding SCS from working quite right, so that's the other thing..)",5,3
I've read different literature about hair loss and changes too. I hate I'm going through that part,4,3
"My SCS is fairly new as well, only about 2 weeks post op. But I have had a great deal of relief so far despite the incision pain and the uncomfortable battery pack. ",5,3
Mine is inserted for my trunkel area and shoulder/arm. The pain in my leg is still there tremendously. I have not had any bad experiences as of yet (pray I don't).,4,3
I totally understand not being able to distinguish the pain level especially because my CRPS started in my Trunkel area (where the surgery had to take place). But with me paying attention to other little things like being able to put my toes on the ground and being able to write some without it hurting made me know something was working.,5,3
I have different programs on my device but hate the one with strong vibration ( guess I have to get use to this foreign object). ,0.333333333,0
"The different programs is for the different things you do. Say for instance you're trying to nap, you'll use the very lite to no vibration program vs using the high vibrations if you try to go for a walk.",0,0
I also found that I have to use the higher vibration doing flare ups.,3.333333333,2
"I do have the issue of the stimulation being so strong that it ""take over"" my wrist and hand ( I'm very small). The rep said that I didn't have to turn it up so much to receive relief.",4,3
I hope the discomfort you're experiencing leaves soon. The device may be both of our lease on a new life so stay positive as well.,2.333333333,1
"Its so nice to have someone that's so close to where I am with the SCS, and what you said made sense. ",4,3
"As well, I know its not at its optimum right now with the seroma (keep an eye out for that on your incision as mine didn't start til almost 10 days post op and was told by neurosurgeon its not uncommon) ",5,3
"As a result i only have the one program on now, which is the high intensity one and i find i have to put it up so high it in itself is uncomfortable. so hoping when i go back in a month i can get new programs and get more benefit from it.",1.333333333,1

Hello all. I've had a lump in my elbow crease for a very long time now (years). Sometimes there is no pain at all but sometimes the pain is quite sharp. ,4,3
I'm guessing that's because it might be pushing down on some nerves in my arm. ,2.666666667,1
Every doctor that I've gone to tells me it's not a big deal and I shouldn't worry about it. Lately it's been bothering me more often than not. ,5,3
Sometimes when I wake up and extend my arm it is quite painful. But sometimes it is not painful at all. ,3.666666667,2
"The swelling seems to come and go. Sometimes it is tender, painless and does not hurt when I push down on it a bit.",4,3

I have had the same lump for a little bit too.  I have both golfers  and tennis elbow. ,4,3
"From what I have found in my research, the lump is caused by the golfers elbow.  I have an arm brace but have found it to cause worse pain. ",4.333333333,3
I have tried hydrocodone as well as morphine with little to no help.  ,5,3
My doctor told me to use ice for the swelling but I don't care for the extra pain of the ice. ,5,3
"I have found that wet heat, as from a shower helps short term. ",1.333333333,1
 I usually have to rest the arm for at least two weeks for it to lower the normal pain load and make the elbow feel somewhat better.  ,4,3
"The only problem with this is that as soon as I go back to normal use, the pain is right back.  ",4,3
"Though this is not all the pain I suffer from, but it is one of the worst. ",4,3

I have the exact same lump in my left elbow crease. I noticed it 8 weeks ago suddenly. It's not hard or soft. It feels like normal tissue. No pain.,4,3
I went to a well respected hand doctor in a large city. He trained at MIT. He told me my lump is a tumor and 100% NOT a muscle-skeletal issue. He started talking about sarcoma.,5,3
I had an MRI today and the tech had to rescan as he found nothing the first time. I came out to 2 radiologists both confused (but not at all worried) because they felt and saw the lump on the outside of my body and could not see it on the inside. ,5,3
Then another doctor came in and showed me the exact same lump in the elbow crease on her arm.,5,3
"The MIT hand Specialist was wrong and jumped to a tumor too fast. It is, in fact, 100% a skeletal issue.",1.66,1
The radiologist said its likely due to over use.

"Any way long story shortish, I got married at 23 to a wonderful man who said he was in it for love and my conditions didn't worry him.",1.333333333,1
Many years later in Novemver 1993 my sister in law had a baby and I got quite depressed and asked to see a gynaecologist again (I had asked about it bit long after we were married abs told it wasn't possible) and he referred me to an IVF clinic to see about egg donation.,5,3
" We were lucky enough to get funding for one try and they found a donor, so on bonfire night 1994 at 08.30 am I had one single embryo implanted.",5,3
"Two weeks later after a blood test we got the news, we were pregnant! July 1995 my beautiful baby daughter was born. Now, I will be 52 on Friday and I have two gorgeous grand-daughters! So don't give up hope. ",4,3
My womb was also under sized apparently but all that happened there is she was 3 weeks early and because of the RA in had a c - section.,5,3
"There are women out there with hearts so big that will help you if you are able to carry, and of course surrogacy is also an option. ",0,0
Just ask and you'll be surprised what solutions are out there. My dad said that medical science would change and I'd have a baby and he was right! ,2.666666667,1
And it's the best thing I ever did. My daughter and my grand-daughters are my absolute world and I hope that you are as lucky as I have been.,0,0
 I'm always here if you want a chat. So I hope my story hag helped you a little. I know I felt like I was the only person in the world like me!,0.333333333,0
"Were you able to breastfeed. I am having a difficult time. The websites say not having ovaries will not affect your milk supply, but I think it does. ",2,1
"Yes, my daughter, 15, was diagnosed yesterday that she was born without ovaries. We still are trying to cope with the news. So, instead of being able to share any story with you, I would love to get to know more from how and how you managed to get along with the news.",0,0
"Hi Marion, I think it was initially harder on my mom when I was first diagnosed since she really understood the scope of it. I am willing to communicate with you and your daughter about my experience.",3.666666667,2
"I too was born without ovaries, I found out when I was about 16. I never thought I would ever have any children.",5,3
"However, I currently have a healthy baby girl. I did ivf with donor eggs and my baby girl is about 2 months now.  The clinic I went to is about half the cost of most clinics and they do payment plans.",5,3
I have a question: did the doctors make you take hormone pills just to make sure that your body will function normally in your life? They told me that I would have to take estrogen pills for my whole life. I need an answer so bad,5,3
"I was put on birth control pills at 16. I'm 35 now and have mixed feelings. I'm told i need the hormones for my body to function properly, but I like not taking them.",5,3
I want to find alternative/natural methods for hormone support. Currently I'm not taking anything and feel fine. (but the Drs would probably scold me for that),4.666666667,3
They make estradiol pills these days. You just let them dissolve under your tongue. These are bioidentical hormone pills so its exactly the same as the body normally makes. Its made from plants so its as close to natural as you can be. Herbal stuff in stores are not the same as human hormones.,0,0
I found out at 17 that I was born without ovaries. The doctors put me on hormonal pills and other pills to help me with my hormones. i was also told to take birth controls for the rest of my life. i am 32 now and I HATE taking the pills. there are times i stoped taking them for a year and felt fine also.,5,3
I'm glad i came across this page. For years I've felt alone and needed help with someone i can relate to. I was diagnosied at 17. ,4,3
 I did not know what was going on with me till I Went to the doctor. the weird part was i was going through puberty but no period. ,5,3
I was devastated and broken when I found out. I wanted to have kids in the future but that gotten taken away. im 32 now. I recentely gotten married and he knew my condition and was accepting of it.,3.666666667,2
Painful intercourse was/is a problem for me. Has anyone tried anything to give comfort?,3,2
"i do sweat now that you say it, i use tripledry or driclor to tey and stip the sweating with some success. its so annoying as i shower and am very clean, hopefully they help x (33, diagnosed at 17, no HRT)",5,3
i sweat a lot especially in my face and head. i use Facesaver 2b i get it off amazon,4,3
"i have not had any painful intercourse. However i do find that if i do not take my tablets my vagina will get slightly dry. so i would advice taking your pills regularly, to make sure your vagina is producing the right amount of discharge etc.",5,3
I get dry from the pills. The pills mess up my body.,5,3
in the 15 years Ib was married it was painful the entire time. that was 20 years ago. I do not plan on have sex again because of the memories of the pain. we tried everything and nothing worked,4.333333333,3
Intercourse was painful every time during 15 years. i have given it up. it is not worth the pain.,4.333333333,3
Im now 36 and have just been referred to a specialist menopause clinic as i had a blood test which showed low oestrogen levels.,5,3
my mum blamed herself and got depressed to the point of suicidal. ,1,0
"Hey, my story is similar to those ive read. when i was 16 i found out that i was born with either absent ovaries or very small ones. i would love to talk with anyone thats living with this condition.",5,3
I have lived with it for 64 years,0.333333333,0
"i was told i have Premature ovarian failure, message me with any further questions.",5,3
I found out at 16 as well and what really stuneed me was when my Dr asked my parents if they wanted me to be male or female!!!!,5,3
I was diagnosed when I was 16 from a laproscopy. I was not started on hormones until my late 20's. the Dr's tried different combinations over the years I have been on prempro for over 20 years now. ,5,3
"I have been very happy with it. I was 5'3"" when I was 16 and did not get any taller. I have never heard of a side effect of growing taller. ",2,1
" I do not think that is part of this condition. I was get another opinion. my life from the age if 16 to my late 50' was very very difficult. a support group, counselor or therapist will help tremendously. ",2.333333333,1
during those years I had many counselors and none understood my condition or were able to help me with the emotional struggles. at age 57 I FINALLY found a fabulous therapist.,5,3
she is an experienced knowledgeable psychologist that helped me get on the correct meds and the correct dosages,5,3
"Hi! i found out at 16 the same type of problem, i dont know my boneage but i will say ive been on estrodial for more than a year now and ive only about half an inch! Id say its a very steady growth even after i thought i stopped. For my doctors and i they dont expect me to grow any more than 5'4",5,3
"I am 26 now, found out i had no ovaries at 16. They wanted me on hormone pills that would help me get a period. Which made no sense cause i never got one before naturally. ",5,3
"Doctors wanted me to take the pills for the rest of my life. I stopped taking them after 2 months of periods. I do a regular check up with my doctor, she says im healthy. So no pills for me thankfully, she does want me to take birth control tho",5,3
"Which also makes no sense since I cant get pregnant. Ive got my hormones checked and they are okay, just basically in menopause early. (Thats how one doctor explained it to me at 17.)",5,3
Im 30 years old. And for 2-3 years Ive had blood in my stool. Once every two or three months or longer.  ,4,3
" I had colonoscopy and results were ok, no cancer, and it shows that I have third degree internal hemhoroids. ",5,3
 every time i feel discomfort or tolerable abdomnal pain thats when I get to have blood in my stool and no pain at all in my anal area. ,4,3
 my doctor is telling me that no problem with my colon and it mght be the hemhoroid. Shes nice to deal with actually and have checked my abdominal area,5,3
Pain in the abdomen is often felt generally. Bright red blood is very often caused by hemorrhoids. In a person of your age that is even more likely to be the cause. ,0,0
 I would concentrate on trying to calm the hemorrhoids - eat more fibre in your diet and do some walking (if you don't at the moment) and try not to sit down too long on a hard seat without having a break from it and spend as little time on the loo as you can manage,0,0
Avoid constipation. Try a hemorrhoid cream and wet wipes. If you calm the hemorrhoids down and the bleeding stops then you have your answer. ,0,0
"IF THE BLOOD IS NOT BRIGHT RED then you might want an endoscopy (stomach camera) to rule out an ulcer. But if the blood is bright red and particularly if it is on the loo paper when you wipe then you can be sure it is the hemorrhoids, which are a nuisance but not serious and suffered by most of us at some point.",2,1
"for the last 3 days ago I get blood on my stool then last night bo blood but my stool is very dark, blackish green, Im getting paranoid everytime I go to the toilet of what might be coming out of me. ",4,3
 Im actually an active person but I had surgery on my right foot 6 konths ago which made me stop all the activites I usually do.,5,3
Im thinking also of endoscopy but I dont wanna tell the doctor on what to do. She jnsist its hemhoroid but Im really scared thats might be not,5,3
"Constipation can make stools darker too. If it is dark brown it is usually normal but actual black, particularly oily or tarry looking, is not normal. ",0,0
"Thank you so much for you insights and advises ill def be going back to the doctor this weekends or by next week, really hoping nothing serious.",5,3
" I have a strong feeling it isn’t anything, let alone anything serious but worth being sure. In 2020 I had a life- threatening bleed because whilst in hospital for something completely different the medicine they gave me caused sudden stomach ulceration so I have a vivid memory of what stomach bleeding looks like.",5,3
My haemoglobin dropped to 5.2 which is a bit on the potentially deadly side but within a week I was back to normal and ulcers all gone in a month or two. ,5,3
I had a colonoscopy 3 years ago. I had a benign polyp that was removed. Dr. said I had hemorroids and said I should repeat Colonoscopy at 50. In the last year I have had occasional blood smear on the toilet paper. ,5,3
 I had a colonoscopy yesterday... I would like to share my experience...,5,3
" I have a pain in my abdomen for 4 years and feel unwell, bloated and in pain almost every day. After many tests - almost all negative, a test for calprotectin came increased so my dr sent me to have a colonoscopy to have a look if there is any sign of IBD. ",5,3
I was really anxious and scared about having the colonoscopy because I have abdominal pain constantly and very sensitive gut but thought that many people had it so I will be fine. ,5,3
This happens more often than one thinks. It happened to me as well and I wanted to sue them. You must complain to the manager or the head of the clinic that you went to.,2.666666667,1
"If enough people complain then doctors will ensure that they take the time to put us out. I wish I had been able to get up and walk out, but I was druged just enough that I couldn't move or protect myself.",4.333333333,3
I will complain to my doctor as they wrote the reason they couldn't finish it was becase I was too stressed and anxious even before the procedure started. Heh it's true but they couldn't finish it because it was extremely painful!,5,3
Most of the NHS doctor are horrible. You must go privately to see a good doctor.,0.333333333,0
 i’ve had several colonoscopies and they are never comfortable. Yesterday i had this procedure and thought i was going to die! ,5,3
"Honestly never in my life have experienced such chronic pain, and with no backing off from the surgeon or staff i felt so vulnerable. Ok they took 40 biopsies and its all for my good but gosh i don’t think i’ll ever forget that day. ",5,3
I'm posting because I don't know anyone who has been in the same situation as all of us and feels better not to suffer alone.,2,1
"I was sedated for the procedure (which was yesterday morning), but have been in pain ever since.",5,3
"I have an anal fissure (basically, a tear) caused by childbirth that led to bleeding, which is why I was sent for a colonoscopy at such a young age. ",5,3
"I had panic attacks going into the procedure (the result of being assaulted), which is why I was fully sedated.",5,3
 My original problem - pain from anal fissure- is worse now after defecating 42 times from the prep liquid and then having a tube go past the tear. ,4.666666667,3
"if you're a woman who just a baby and is diagnosed with a fissure, I strongly urge you not to get a colonoscopy unless you have a family history of cancer or several indicators. ",0,0
"Ideas that are helping me heal (well, before the colonoscopy wrecked me again) - stay hydrated, put your feet on a stool for bowel moments, get a prescription for lidocaine nifedipine, eat well, and find a pelvic floor physical therapist. ",5,3
Have had similar experience. Curious how was the out come? Like you I'm wondering why I had so much pain 3/4 through colonoscopy? ,5,3
I have heard that some Endoscopists are much rougher and/or rushed than others.  Also some pump in more gas than others. ,0.333333333,0
" I was admitted to the hospital for extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, and headaches. ",4.666666667,3
I was diagnosed with migraines and the lumbar puncture was just one of the many tests that they ran.,5,3
I also never had any follow headaches but a very sore back.,4,3
I asked my consultant when will the pain stop he replied usually a few days after the LP but if it continues after a week consult with my GP for further advise.,4.666666667,3
"I have been to my neurologist as well as the er where it was done they all just keep saying give it time. Its been to much time though. It is pretty scary.",5,3
"After having it for almost two years, I can finally say my symptoms are FINALLY showing improvements!!",2,1
I've tried literally everything on this planet from antibiotics to hydrogen peroxide to tea tree to garlic to lemon to coconut oil to vinegar to yoghurt.. still nothing.,5,3
"I have also tried every antibiotic possible, as prescribed by my Gyno. And home remedies, including tea tree oil, hydrogen peroxide etc. I hope it works for this unbearable odor! I can’t even live a normal social life because of it. ",5,3
"must going through forums to try and find a solution for BV, and found this one.",1.66,1
I'm going to try this as well I have tried everything and nothing has worked or has got any better. I need to find something that works. I have been suffering for 2 years now.,3,2
So I have an increased discharge with a little itch. I went to the doctors to get checked up and was told I have thrush and was given a tablet. I'm not normally fused with thrush because I've always had this on and off.,5,3
 I'm happy to say I'm BV FREE. ,3,2
"From GP's, gyno's, naturopaths, home remedies and even accupuncture. For 5 years i struggled with it and anything that i found to relieve it was a very short temporary fix. I thought about buying shares in yogurt companies to at least get some return on the amount i was buying and going through to get a bit of relief.",4.666666667,3
I woke in the morning still having forgotten about it and went about my motherly duties. ,0.333333333,0
 I  have had all symptoms of BV gone since finding this product and i am so glad that i was able to get past the sceptisism and do it. ,4.666666667,3
So where to go to order it and how much is it I'm going threw bv right now and have had it for over 5 years I need to back the way I use to be,4.333333333,3
I had sex with my ex and the condom broke. I had a really foul smell so I went to the dr to get tested. Everything thing came back negative but I ended up getting a yeast infection and BV.(that’s when my bv arrived and hasn’t left),5,3
" I had BV for the past 6-7 years, every day ... never a break.. it destroys underwear, and became rather embarrassing in the bedroom department. ",4.666666667,3
" I tried 1000mg of hemp oil capsules a day, helped a lot with twitching under the skin and muscles.",5,3
