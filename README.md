# Medical-self-disclosure-dataset

Labels were assigned using a graded labeling scheme ranging from 0-5, with a label of “0” indicating no self-disclosure and a label of “5” indicating high self-disclosure (Continuous Labels). We then  binned our score ranges as follows to produce four classes: [0-1] NOSD, (1-3) LOWSD, [3-4) MEDSD, and [4-5] HIGHSD (Graded Labels).
